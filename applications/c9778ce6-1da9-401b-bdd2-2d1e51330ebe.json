  "description": "The libp2p Community Architect role is focused on keeping everything going behind the scenes as a \"meta maintainer\" across the whole community. My role is one of connector, mentor, IT support, calendar jockey, events planner, (virutal/IRL) meeting emcee, developer recruiter, problem solver, PR person, blogger, libp2p cheerleader, and libp2p technical fellow. I have helped grow the libp2p community from 3 active implementation projects to 10 active implementation projects since November or 2024. I also coordinate and mentor grant-funded developers coming into the libp2p community so that they accomplish meaningful work with the sponsorship funding the project receives. The libp2p networking library is an integral part of the Filecoin stack and is used by most organizations in the Filecoin ecosystem. The libp2p project is often overlooked as a critical piece of the infrastructure and caring for it on a day-to-day basis is often a thankless job that receives little attention. There is a community of about 200 people who care about libp2p and contribute regularly...I am one of them.",
  "additional_impact": "I personally recruited a member of the Ethereum Foundation's Python programmers to take over maintainership of py-libp2p when it had been archived and abandoned for 2+ years. He agreed on the condition that I find him help ASAP. That was in March of 2024. By November of 2024, I had recruited 4 other developers and was welcoming in our first cohort of Protocol Labs Developer Guild (PLDG) developers to help. Since November of 2024, two of the PLDG developers have been promoted to full maintainer (Manu and Luca) and we have a cadre of 10 primary contributors. They have even branched out to taking over the py-multiaddrs, py-multihash and several other Python Multiformats libraries. The best part is that the project is nearing 1.0 feature parity with go-libp2p, js-libp2p, and rust-libp2p. It is also making significant progress in the AI developer community and getting libp2p into new areas of application.\n\nIn addition to the py-libp2p implemenation project success, I also spent considerable time building a relationship with the nim-libp2p when they were a completely separate community not integrated with the broader libp2p community. I started in January or 2024 and in November 2024, I organized a nim-libp2p 1 hour takeover of libp2p day. Their developers took over for an hour and presented all of their research on gossipsub scaling efforts and the new features they were adding to nim-libp2p. Those presentations set off a flurry of gassipsub improvements that are now landing in the other implementations to support the Lean Consensus project backed by the Ethereum Foundation. My efforts to integrate the nim-libp2p project more tightly with the other implementations led to significant improvements in GossipSub that impacts all users of libp2p.\n\nI have also mentored and directed almost 100 new developers that have come to the libp2p project as part of the PLDG. I have turned those people into countless meaningful improvements, big and small, to libp2p across all implementations. Without me coordinating efforts, the money spent on stipends would have been misdirected. Many of the implementation maintainers did not have the bandwidth to handle the mentorship load and so I filled that role so we didn't miss capturing this energy and effort.",
  "end_user": "The primary beneficiaries of my effort are the maintainers of the various libp2p implementation projects (e.g. go-libp2p, js-libp2p, rust-libp2p, etc) as I spend a lot of time running down technical issues, organizing meetings, recruiting and mentoring developers, and generally supporting them in every way I can. The rest of the community benefits from there being somebody \"keeping the lights on\" and organizing community events, maintaining the website and calendar and video meeting platform.",
  "testimonials": "Being the community architect for the libp2p community is somewhat thankless. I haven't gathered them, but I would be happy to point you to the maintainers of the various libp2p implementation projects that I serve.",
