  "description": "The BigQuery Data Repository provides comprehensive access to the Filecoin blockchain’s full history through Google BigQuery. It enables users to retrieve raw data or perform SQL queries directly on the blockchain, covering every aspect—from blocks and messages to sectors, miners, FVM, and actor states. Unlike other ecosystem tools that focus on some of these aspects, this repository offers complete data coverage. Because maintaining a Filecoin node for data extraction is complex and expensive, BigQuery serves as a cost-effective solution for both casual and advanced users seeking reliable, public access to detailed blockchain information.\n\n**Recent Progress**\n* Added new internal checks for data robustness, completeness and currency\n* Responded to approximately 10 ad hoc requests for data availability, query logic etc\n* Added new data dumps for the Filecoin Virtual Machine, covering transactions, receipts, and contract data",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "The BigQuery Data Repository is an essential tool for any ecosystem stakeholder who may require full blockchain data at the most granular level (e.g. at the level of individual messages, transactions and sectors), which is often not available from any other public source. It is the primary data source for virtually all ecosystem teams that build on granular blockchain data to compose analytics and insights, such as the Filecoin Data Portal, or Filecoin’s internal security monitoring team.",
  "testimonials": "No direct links to testimonials, but we regularly field questions about availability of certain data types, how to query the tables, etc.",
