  "description": "Chain.love (formerly Glif Nodes) powers the Filecoin ecosystem with open, reliable infrastructure.\n\nBetween Nov 2024 – Sep 2025, we sustained *4B+ requests/month* via public RPC endpoints, maintained *bootstrap nodes for mainnet/testnet*, and shipped developer tooling like *Docker images and Helm charts*.\n\nFollowing two RetroPGF recognitions, we evolved into *Chain.love*, and launched the Toolbox: a unified hub where developers can discover, compare, and connect to blockchain service providers that fit them best.\n\nOn top of that, we launched *Ethereum Attestation Service* support: indexed attestations on Filecoin, programmatic key management: key management with credit-based limits and IP filters\nand Subgraph improvements that provide advanced management functionality, like logs, or versioning.",
  "additional_impact": "Beyond technical improvements, Chain.love brought transparency across the Filecoin ecosystem by introducing Toolbox. \n\nOur public APIs, dashboards, and developer widgets have become important resources for new node operators and ecosystem contributors.  \n\nAdditionally we developed an open-source widget (https://github.com/Chain-Love/widget), that is supposed to provide a convenient way to compare providers in the Filecoin ecosystem. We created a pull request (https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/pull/2433) to insert this widget in the official Filecoin documentation. You may see the examples of how it looks like here: https://chain-love.gitbook.io/chain-love-docs/help-and-faq/example-of-our-widget \n\nOn top of that, we were participating in the first attempts of integrations of the earliest implementation of the x402 idea into the Filecoin ecosystem, and are committed to become the actual first x402 provider.\n\nSince Filecoin ecosystem supports several blockchain clients that have their own features and flaws, we've developed a system to route traffic to specific implementation that performs best under current conditions.",
  "end_user": "Developers, node operators, and ecosystem partners across the Filecoin network are the main beneficiaries.\nChain.love provides them with stable RPC access, archival data, subgraph indexing, and tools to manage and monitor their workloads.\n\nBy simplifying discovery, comparison, and integration of Web3 infrastructure services, it reduces setup time and fragmentation for builders, while improving reliability and transparency for the network.\nUltimately, every Filecoin user—dApps, wallets, analytics platforms, or researchers—benefits from faster, more resilient access to network data and core infrastructure.",
