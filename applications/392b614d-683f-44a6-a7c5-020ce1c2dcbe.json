  "description": "What began as a file-sharing idea at the PLGenesis hackathon has transformed into Filosign: a mission to build the foundation for digital trust. During the Filecoin Alpha Cohort 2025, we built our MVP, delivering on this mission by integrating Post-Quantum security and enterprise multi-sig features. Our impact is a platform that provides mathematical certainty for the most critical on-chain agreements. Our journey now leads us to the Filecoin Dev Summit and DePIN Day in Argentina, where we will demonstrate the future of verifiable contracts.",
  "additional_impact": "Our most significant impact is future-proofing the very concept of a digital agreement for the entire Web3 ecosystem. To achieve this, our primary impact is in bridging the gap from low-level cryptographic theory to a high-level enterprise application focused on verifiable trust. We didn't just build a signing feature; we built the entire trust stack, from the low-level post-quantum cryptographic primitives up to the on-chain verification contracts and a seamless user application.\n\nBy integrating enterprise-grade multi-sig support and gasless transactions, we simplify the user experience for complex corporate workflows. This makes Filosign the vital solution for organizations requiring future-proof security and irrefutable proof for their agreements, establishing Filecoin as the safest and most reliable platform to conduct high-stakes business.",
  "end_user": "Our end-users are primarily Web3-native organizations and forward-thinking enterprises that require a higher standard of security and verifiability for their agreements. This includes:\n\n- Web3 Organizations: DAOs, DeFi protocols, and crypto funds who need to execute critical on-chain and off-chain agreements in a trustless, verifiable manner that aligns with their decentralized operations.\n\n- Enterprises & High-Value Sectors: Legal teams, finance departments, and IP managers who are handling high-value digital assets and long-term contracts. They benefit from our future-proof security, ensuring their agreements remain confidential and tamper-proof for decades to come.",
  "testimonials": "As an active project within the Filecoin Alpha Cohort 2025, our vision and execution have been met with significant validation. Our progress was formally recognized when we were awarded the #1 rank on the Akindo Buildathon leaderboard by cohort judges.\n\nCrucially, our mission is actively championed within the Filecoin ecosystem by key figures like Timothy Fong, who is providing strategic guidance to boost our path to market. This internal support is complemented by encouragement from respected communities like the BuidlGuidl and praise from EF's Austin Griffith.\n\nSome comments about Filosign from Alpha Cohort Judges:\n\nLongfei: \"This is one of the best UI/UX projects. It's amazing to see the demo to the Ethereum Foundation and the valuable feedback you're getting to bring this product to the real world.\"\n\nPatrick Woodhead: \"You've very clearly articulated the problem. The core innovation ('Irrevocable Signature') is crisp, easy to understand, and differentiating. Great engagement in the community.\"\n\nSarah: \"This is a strong product-market fit. Great job getting user feedback and testing with experienced users. The innovative ideas are excellent.\"\n\nNick: \"You have a strong foundation with substantial progress in both UI/UX design and architectural planning. The user experience appears well-thought-out. Now, execute on the vision!\"\n\nddubravac: \"The enterprise fit is clear.\"\n\nTippyFlits: \"FiloSign is a sharp, well-defined idea executed with care. The concept of on-chain ‘irrevocable signatures’... gives real weight to enterprise use cases. The strong delivery and polish are clear.\"\n\npyropy: \"This is a strong core technology that could be transformative.\"",
