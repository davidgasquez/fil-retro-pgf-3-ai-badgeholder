  "description": "Filecoin Checker is a tool for monitoring the WindowedPoSt status of Filecoin miners. It can check miners' WindowedPoSt submission status and faulty sector count in real-time, sending notifications through various channels when problems occur, helping miners discover and resolve issues promptly.\nDuring this period, the miner of the whole network was monitored. When a problem occurs, you can contact the SP in time to inform them that there is a problem.",
  "additional_impact": "I believe this is a groundbreaking tool. The tool itself is not complex, but it condenses years of experience. I know there are some types of monitoring in curio, and I think it's not perfect, and the user experience is very poor.\nWhat I need to do is to make it very simple for anyone involved in filecoin to learn about the status of their nodes without needing very professional knowledge.\nAnd I am willing to open a group to guide users in using this tool or to answer questions related to filecoin (I have been doing this).",
  "end_user": "Storage Provider\nOver the past few years, SP has often encountered hardware problems, code problems and other problems. We know that such problems cannot be solved immediately. But we can find the problem in time, recover the loss, and not expand the loss. This is the original intention of this project. Using this project to cooperate with the alarm, it can be found before the problem has occurred, so that users can have time to deal with errors and avoid losses; at the same time, inexperienced users can quickly start the configuration.",
  "testimonials": "https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C06LF5YP8S3/p1760061291510959\n\nIn many cases, I will remind the SP that can be contacted that there is a problem with their node.",
