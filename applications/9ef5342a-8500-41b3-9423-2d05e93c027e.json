  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Venus team successfully led the implemention of FIP-0077, introducing deposit requirements for new miner creation to reduce network chain storage burden, resource waste, and gas cost increases caused by inactive and unused miner actors.\n\nThe Venus component Droplet was upgraded to support smart contract-based DataCap distribution, facilitating verified storage deals that command higher returns.",

  "description": "Venus, the second implementation of Filecoin specification, enhances network resilience by reducing single-point-of-failure risks and currently supports about 13% of network active miners. It lowers barriers to entry for storage providers, thereby fostering ecosystem growth.  In the past year, Venus has facilitated critical network upgrades, including core built-in actor upgrades, FIP integrations, and F3 snapshot implementation. Additionally, Venus has released versions supporting the FIL+ program and implementing essential security updates.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "SPs are the primary end users benefiting from Venus as an alternative Filecoin implementation. Venus provides operational flexibility through its modular, service-oriented architecture that separates chain service, messaging, mining, and storage management. This shared-service model lowers barriers to entry for smaller miners while reducing hardware and operational costs. The Filecoin network itself is a secondary beneficiary, gaining increased decentralization and resilience from multiple independent protocol implementations that reduce single-point-of-failure risks.",
