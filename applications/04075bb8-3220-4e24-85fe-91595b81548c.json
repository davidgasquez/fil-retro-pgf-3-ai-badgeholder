  "filecoin_growth_impact": "CIDgravity has directly contributed to growing the Filecoin ecosystem by **onboarding new users**.  \n\n- **New Users Onboarded:** Over the last month, we have onboarded **117 new users** via the CIDgravity Nextcloud app.  \n- **User Profile:** These are Nextcloud users for whom **privacy and private cloud storage are key concerns**. By integrating Filecoin into their workflows, they can now store and manage data in a **decentralized, secure, and verifiable manner**.",

  "description": "The CIDgravity Nextcloud App seamlessly integrates decentralized storage into your Nextcloud instance, enabling users to store and retrieve files directly on the Filecoin network. By adding IPFS and Filecoin as external storage backends, this app transforms Nextcloud into a decentralized cloud solution, offering enhanced data security, immutability, and long-term availability. Ideal for users seeking to combine the familiarity of Nextcloud with the benefits of decentralized storage.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "- The primary end‑users of our integration are users of the Nextcloud platform — i.e., individuals and organisations that host or access Nextcloud instances and can benefit from our “CIDgravity Nextcloud App” to back up, off‑load or archive data to the Filecoin network.  \n- According to publicly available data:  \n  - Nextcloud is estimated to have **well over 20 million users** spread over tens of thousands of server deployments. \n  - There are more than **400,000 separate Nextcloud deployments** reported in 2022.",
  "testimonials": "We do not actively track the number of formal reviews or testimonials. However, CIDgravity has built a strong reputation within the Filecoin ecosystem, recognized for its reliability, performance, and close collaboration with core projects.\n\nOur strong partnerships and ongoing community engagement reflect consistently positive feedback from developers and ecosystem partners, even if not formally quantified.",
