  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Lotus, Builtin Actors, and ref-FVM form the foundation for every on-chain transaction and smart-contract execution on the Filecoin network.\n\nAll FIL-denominated activity - including storage and retrieval deals, DataCap allocations, verified client onboarding, and miner operations - depends on the actor logic implemented and maintained by FilOz.\n\nBy delivering stable network upgrades and ensuring deterministic execution across clients, these implementations safeguard billions of FIL in value transfer and collateral, supporting an active and reliable storage economy.",

  "description": "Throughout the RetroPGF Round 3 evaluation period, the FilOz team maintained and advanced Lotus, Builtin Actors, and ref-FVM - the core implementations that power the Filecoin network. These updates improved sync performance, reduced resource usage, streamlined network upgrades (NV25–NV27), and enhanced on-chain actor logic and FVM spec alignment through [FIP-0105](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0105.md), [FIP-0106](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0106.md), and [FIP-0109](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0109.md). Together, these implementations form the foundation of Filecoin node operations, ensuring network reliability, execution consistency, and ongoing protocol innovation.",
  "additional_impact": "The FilOz team’s work on Lotus, Builtin Actors, and ref-FVM extends beyond software maintenance.\n\nThese repositories anchor cross-client collaboration through the Implementers Working Group, provide spec alignment and testing infrastructure for new protocol features, and ensure that network upgrades reach mainnet safely.\n\nThey also enable rapid debugging and incident response across the Filecoin ecosystem, strengthening resilience and developer confidence in the network’s core architecture.",
  "end_user": "The primary beneficiary is the Filecoin network itself, which depends on Lotus, Builtin Actors, and ref-FVM as the foundational implementations that make the protocol function.\n\nThese components define the rules, logic, and execution environment that enable every Filecoin transaction and upgrade.\n\nThey are also relied on by most infrastructure and tooling providers, including RPC services and developer platforms, for stable access to the network.\n\nThrough this work, FilOz ensures the reliability and continuity of the entire Filecoin ecosystem.",
  "testimonials": "FilOz received consistent positive feedback from developers and ecosystem partners during NV25–NV27 upgrade coordination. Teams from Forest, Venus, and several Storage Providers noted the clarity of documentation, responsiveness to issues, and stability of network upgrades in Implementers WG calls, Slack discussions, and GitHub threads.\n\nThis feedback was informal but sustained across multiple channels, reflecting strong trust and appreciation from other Filecoin implementation teams and operators.\n\nFurther reflections on FilOz’s engineering work and upgrade stewardship can be found on our [Medium page](https://medium.com/@filoz).",
