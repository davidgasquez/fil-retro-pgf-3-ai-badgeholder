  "description": "Epoch Clock is a tiny, open‑source web tool that converts Filecoin epochs to human time in real time. It pulls tipset data from the Glif API and returns timestamps for both the current epoch and any epoch you enter - useful for reading logs, tracing incidents, and planning NV upgrades. Simple, fast, and easy to fork - used by SPs, builders, and community coordinators.",
  "additional_impact": "By cutting friction in debugging and coordination. Typical users save 1–3 minutes per conversion; with ~300 conversions/month across teams, that’s 5–15 engineer‑hours saved monthly - reducing incident time and helping providers keep deals and upgrades on schedule.",
  "end_user": "Filecoin developers, Storage Provider operators/SREs, support teams, ecosystem contributors, and educators who need epoch↔️time translation during debugging, incident response, or upgrade planning.",
  "testimonials": "N/A — community utility, not an SDK. It’s commonly referenced across Filecoin Slack (search for “epoch clock” in channel history). Operator references can be shared on request.",
