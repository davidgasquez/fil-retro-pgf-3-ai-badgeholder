  "description": "Retrieval Tester became the practical open source CLI developers use to prove that data tied to a CID is actually retrievable on Filecoin and other networks that use CIDs. Built by Dapps over Apps in partnership with the Filecoin Foundation, it standardized retrieval benchmarking across success rate, latency, and provider availability, and fit cleanly into CI workflows. Teams used it to prequalify storage providers, catch regressions before production, and lower support incidents. Early momentum of over one thousand downloads grew into sustained adoption for deal quality assurance, audits, and monitoring.",

  "end_user": "## Contribution & Impact\n\n**Retrieval Tester** is an open-source CLI that verifies whether content addressed by a CID is retrievable. It standardizes real-world benchmarking; success rate, latency, and provider availability and outputs machine-readable results for CI, QA, and audits.\n\n### Key contributions\n- Scriptable retrieval checks for any CID (Filecoin, IPFS, and other CID-based networks)\n- Consistent metrics with JSON/CSV output for dashboards and pipelines\n- Pre-deal and post-deal workflows to qualify storage providers and catch regressions\n- Replaces ad-hoc scripts with a maintained, repeatable tool\n\n### Impact \n- Organic adoption and continued ecosystem use\n- Faster provider due diligence and fewer retrieval incidents in production\n- Clearer accountability for retrieval SLAs via repeatable tests and shared benchmarks\n- Increased developer confidence in building on Filecoin\n\n## Who is the end user that benefits from the project?\n\n- Developers integrating CID-based storage\n- Data owners / storage clients validating provider quality\n- DevOps / platform teams enforcing retrieval checks in CI/CD\n- Storage providers conducting QA and publishing performance\n- Researchers / auditors running standardized retrieval studies",

This improves reliability for **FVM applications** that depend on retrievable data, but it **doesn’t create a package-level dependency** on our CLI—hence “0” direct dependents.\n\n**How it benefits FVM projects in practice (indirect use):**\n- **Pre-deal gates**: projects verify retrievability before invoking FVM actors related to deals, renewals, or SLAs.  \n- **Operational QA**: scheduled checks reduce data-related incidents that would surface in FVM workflows.  \n- **Pipeline inputs**: JSON/CSV outputs feed bots/services that interact with FVM actors.\n\n**Available/Planned integration paths (to make dependencies explicit if desired):**\n- **Webhook output** that can trigger off-chain agents which call FVM actor methods.  \n- **Example adapters** (Action/script) to post benchmark results to a specified actor endpoint.  \n- **Documented schema** so FVM projects can incorporate retrievability checks as a required step.",
