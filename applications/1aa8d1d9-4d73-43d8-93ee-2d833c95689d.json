  "description": "MUSE (Modular Stack of Evidence) is an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) support system designed specifically for digital public goods. EBP is including impact evaluation and MUSE addresses persistent barriers such as fragmented evidence and the high complexity of data collection.\n\nMUSE seamlessly integrates three core functions: evidence curation, citation, and cultivation. It structures global evidence into reusable \"evidence cards\" stored in EAS that practitioners can combine to build logic models, directly linking evidence to project design and execution. They're issued as Hypercerts, which can be verified. MUSE fosters accountability and helps builders accelerate planning, while enabling funders to make data-driven decisions.",

  "end_user": "1. Builders / Implementers (Practitioners)\n\nThis group includes the individuals or teams actively developing and executing digital public goods. MUSE provides them with tools to enhance their planning and effectiveness.\n\n- MUSE accelerates project planning and improves outcome predictability.\n- It enables practitioners to easily build and implement action plans (logic models) that lead to tangible outcomes by combining structured evidence.\n- It allows builders to articulate scientifically grounded logic models during the planning (P) phase of the PDCA cycle.\n- MUSE empowers practitioners to maximize social impact.\n- It ensures that successful practices are rapidly shared and scaled across communities and domains.\n- It lowers the barriers associated with adopting Evidence-based Practice (EBP).\n\n2. Funders / Government Agencies\n\nThis group includes entities like DAOs, foundations, and government agencies responsible for funding and resource allocation within the DPG space.\n\n- MUSE enables data-driven decision-making and more effective resource allocation.\n- It provides a scientific basis for judgment and offers evidence-based evaluation criteria that are distinct from arbitrary value judgments or purely democratic decision-making.\n- By helping to prioritize proposals with verifiable pathways to impact, MUSE strengthens the efficiency and sustainability of public goods funding.\n- It helps funding bodies avoid the depletion of funds on projects with unverified outcomes.\n- It allows for the reconciliation of diverse value systems, enabling funding decisions to be based on scientific validity.\n\n3. Society as a Whole\n\nThe project contributes broadly to the overall health and effectiveness of efforts to solve social challenges.\n\n- MUSE elevates the quality of the digital public goods ecosystem.\n- It cultivates a culture of solving social problems through evidence and data.\n- It strengthens accountability and transparency to stakeholders, including citizens and beneficiaries.\n- By enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of \"good\" DPG projects, it indirectly supports differential acceleration toward a safer and better world.\n- Ultimately, MUSE contributes directly to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",
  "testimonials": "We are basically contributing to public goods space. Actually, we had a presentation at Devcon SEA and co-worked as a member of Grant Innovation Lab. We have covered grant programs by Filecoin and Protocol Labs. Also, we are supported by Funding the Commons and Filecoin ecosystems. We have joined Funding the Commons Berlin/Taipei/Tokyo/Bangkok. A member of us accepted to Impact Evaluation Research Retreat hosted by Juan Benet. And then, Drips team supported us because our approach alignes with them.\n\n- Presentation Devcon SEA: https://youtu.be/YyoQSc4iDPk?si=A_CO8XokErJ40uEy\n- Report of Grant Innovation Lab: https://grant.metagov.org/\n- Funding the Commons: https://www.fundingthecommons.io/bangkok-2024\n- Impact Evaluation Research Retreat: https://beaconlabs.io/reports/ierr2025/",

  "governance_accessibility_impact": "MUSE, designed as an Evidence-based Practice (EBP) support system for Digital Public Goods (DPGs), enhances governance accessibility for members of the Filecoin ecosystem by improving the transparency, fairness, and scientific rigor of decision-making processes, especially in funding programs like FIL-Retro PGF.\n\nMUSE achieves this by acting as the crucial \"Evidence Communication\" layer that lowers the barrier to utilizing scientific knowledge for both funders and builders.\n\nHere is how MUSE makes governance more accessible to Filecoin ecosystem members:\n\n1. Enhancing the Fairness and Efficacy of Funding Decisions\n\nFor funders and government agencies within the ecosystem (who allocate capital, like those running FIL-Retro PGF), MUSE provides a rational and persuasive basis for their decisions, making the allocation process more transparent and trustworthy.\n\n- Data-Driven Resource Allocation: MUSE enables data-driven decision-making and more effective resource allocation. This is critical for programs like Filecoin's Retro Funding, which the sources classify as efforts that \"use\" evidence.\n- Scientific Basis for Judgment: It provides evidence-based evaluation criteria that are distinct from arbitrary judgments or purely democratic decision-making. This supplies a scientific basis for judgment.\n- Improving Program Quality: By prioritizing proposals with verifiable pathways to impact, MUSE ensures funding is directed effectively, thereby avoiding the risk of fund depletion on projects with unverified outcomes. This makes governance processes, such as reviewing grant applications, more sound and acceptable to the community.\n\n2. Lowering Barriers for Builders and Strengthening Proposal Persuasion\n\nFor builders and practitioners creating DPGs in the ecosystem, MUSE democratizes the use of scientific knowledge, making it easier to acquire funding and participate in the governance process.\n\n- Making EBP Accessible: MUSE lowers the barriers to EBP by making complex scientific knowledge readily available and usable by anyone. This directly addresses the difficulty practitioners face in formulating causal models required for EBP.\n- Accelerating Planning: For builders, MUSE accelerates project planning and improves outcome predictability. This is achieved by allowing them to easily combine curated evidence cards into scientifically grounded logic models.\n- Strengthening Funding Proposals: The ability to present a project with a clear, scientifically grounded logic model enhances a builder's persuasion when seeking funding. By structuring evidence—including the impact of non-technical activities like OSS contributions—MUSE provides the proof needed for funding acceptance.\n\n3. Fostering Consensus and Plurality\n\nMUSE integrates scientific rigor with community values, enhancing the legitimacy of decisions across the broader ecosystem.\n\n- Fostering Consensus: MUSE allows stakeholders, including communities, to form persuasive consensus about which projects are meaningful.\n- Supporting Diverse Values (Plurality): MUSE’s design promotes a world that respects diverse values. It supports more plural and trusted decision-making by combining scientific validity with diverse community value systems. This prevents the funding mechanisms from becoming unilaterally reliant on a single value framework (such as purely algorithmic funding).\n- Enhancing Accountability: By supporting the construction of simplified logic models, MUSE visualizes the logical pathway of initiatives, thereby ensuring transparent planning and accountability to all stakeholders, including beneficiaries.",
