  "filecoin_growth_impact": "The Curio Snark Market enables FIL-denominated proof computation trades between independent nodes, introducing a new economic loop for Filecoin. Since launch, Curio has processed hundreds of live FIL settlements between compute sellers and proof buyers, representing the first open marketplace for Filecoin proofs. This new transaction flow broadens FIL utility beyond storage and helps stabilize the network’s compute economy.",

  "description": "The Curio Snark Market enables decentralized proof computation within Filecoin. Since November 2024, it has connected independent GPU providers with storage miners through a live marketplace for SNARK generation, settling FIL-denominated payments in production. By decoupling proof computation from storage, Curio unlocks new earning opportunities, scales Filecoin’s proving layer, and increases network efficiency through open, competitive compute markets.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "Filecoin storage providers, GPU operators, and ecosystem developers benefit directly. Storage providers gain scalable, low-latency proof computation without needing expensive GPUs. GPU operators can earn FIL by selling compute cycles, increasing network decentralization. Developers benefit from transparent APIs, telemetry, and marketplace analytics integrated into the Curio protocol and dashboard.",
