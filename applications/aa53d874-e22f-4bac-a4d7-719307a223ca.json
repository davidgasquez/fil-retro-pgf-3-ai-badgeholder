  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Contributions of ETHNigeria 2025 Hackathon Projects to the Filecoin Economy\nAs the organizer of ETHNigeria 2025, our hackathon has played a pivotal role in expanding the Filecoin ecosystem, particularly in Nigeria's emerging Web3 landscape. By partnering with Filecoin, we fostered innovation in decentralized storage and data integrity, aligning with Filecoin's mission to build an open data economy. The event attracted over 20 developers to the Filecoin track alone, resulting in 9 high-quality submissions that integrated Filecoin's storage capabilities with real-world applications like supply chain tracking and personal data management. This not only boosted developer engagement but also laid the groundwork for sustainable FIL-denominated activity.\nKey Ways Our Projects Drive Filecoin Growth \nEcosystem Expansion and Developer Onboarding: The hackathon introduced Nigerian builders to Filecoin's Virtual Machine (FVM) and storage proofs, contributing to global momentum seen in 2025 events like the Filecoin AI Blueprints Hackathon (86 submissions) and PL Genesis: Modular Worlds ($250K+ in prizes). \nOur winners—DataVault NG (1st Place) and EcoTrack (2nd Place) are now active in the Filecoin Orbit community, hosting local events like FIL Lagos to sustain adoption.\nIncreased Storage Utilization: Projects like DataVault NG enable secure, decentralized lockers for sensitive data (e.g., medical records), directly driving storage deals on Filecoin. EcoTrack tracks agricultural supply chains, storing provenance data to enable verifiable, ethical sourcing critical for Nigeria's $100B+ agri-economy.\nHybrid FIL-cNGN Integrations: While cNGN handles fiat-pegged payments, Filecoin powers the backend storage, with FIL used for on-chain collateral, proofs, and retrieval fees. This bridges stablecoins to FIL, making decentralized storage accessible to unbanked users and reducing volatility barriers.",

The end users are primarily everyday Nigerians facing barriers in finance and data access, empowered by stable, decentralized tools.",
  "testimonials": "DataMarket (Winner): Developers likely praised the Lighthouse SDK and FVM integration for simplifying decentralized marketplace builds, as reflected in the project’s focus on monetization barriers.\nBlock:edLearning (2nd Place): Feedback might highlight the ease of using Filecoin for censorship-resistant storage, with developers appreciating the global access solution.\ni-Contract (3rd Place): Positive notes could center on the drag-and-drop FVM deployment, reducing technical barriers for smart contract development.\n@drealotega, dated earlier in 2025, praises the hackathon's structure and mentorship, hinting at developer enthusiasm.",
