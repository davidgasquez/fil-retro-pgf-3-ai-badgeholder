  "filecoin_growth_impact": "The project directly contributes to the Filecoin economy by enabling FIL-denominated transactions across medical billing, decentralized storage subscriptions, and open-source software development — totaling approximately $15,000 USD equivalent to date.\n\nWe launched PPT and MEDI Tokens on the Filecoin Mainnet, integrated with SushiSwap for liquidity and payment routing. These tokens facilitate real-world FIL utility in healthcare and civic data systems.\n\nAdditionally, FIL payments are used for mentoring developers to deploy Filecoin smart contracts for health data handling, claims management, and recurring billing, expanding FIL’s application beyond storage into sustainable Web3 public-good infrastructure.\n\n📂 Transaction records and supporting documentation:\n\nShort link (https://tinyurl.com/Filecoin-txns-OP-Medicine)\n\nFull Drive folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13RBk9ySIn6iaamWvDMJcs7f-3XaoIV2R?usp=drive_link)\n\nQuick links in GitHub (https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EMTTR/blob/main/Filecoin-RetroPGF.md#-quick-links)",

  "description": "OP Medicine on Filecoin builds open, verifiable healthcare infrastructure using Filecoin storage and FVM smart contracts.\n\n Since November 2024, it has powered two Code for GovTech healthcare pilots, deploying decentralized medical billing, token-gated data pipelines, and transparent clinical record systems anchored on Filecoin/IPLD.\n\nIn 2025, OP Medicine launched the PPT Token on Filecoin Mainnet and SushiSwap, enabling token-gated access to the Web3 Medical Billing system.\n\n Through EMTTR, the project delivers affordable, auditable, and privacy-first digital health tools for hospitals, researchers, and civic projects — advancing Filecoin’s real-world public good adoption.",
  "additional_impact": "The project has created public-good infrastructure connecting Filecoin to healthcare and government data systems, demonstrating its real-world viability beyond financial applications.\n\nIt has promoted Filecoin adoption across academic and civic innovation networks such as NSUT, Code for GovTech, and Gates Foundation–linked programs, fostering education and awareness around decentralized storage and verifiable data protocols.\n\nThrough the Smart India Hackathon (S.I.H.), the project enabled participation of 600+ developers, introducing Filecoin-based problem statements and cross-ecosystem integrations with Starknet and Stellar via py-libp2p: please visit https://github.com/seetadev/py-libp2p/issues , https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/discussions/1004 and https://github.com/libp2p/py-libp2p/discussions/933 (project areas for S.I.H. 2026).\n\nOne of the OP Medicine maintainers also serves as a co-maintainer of key Filecoin ecosystem libraries — py-libp2p, py-multiaddr (multiformats), and py-cid (IPLD) — directly advancing the developer infrastructure that underpins Filecoin’s interoperability.\n\n🔗Community presentation on py-libp2p use cases at Engres, The Gathering (please visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x1cOfSsSys )\n\nThe project has also advanced privacy-first medical data standards, leveraging ZK proofs and IPLD-based record verifiability to ensure secure, auditable data provenance.\n\nCollectively, these efforts have expanded Filecoin’s visibility and utility across the digital public health, education, and open-source civic-tech ecosystems — positioning it as a trusted backbone for non-financial, public-benefit use cases.",
  "end_user": "Our end users include:\n\nPublic hospitals & civic healthcare agencies using OP Medicine for transparent billing and data records.\n\nDevelopers & startups integrating Filecoin-powered medical data systems through EMTTR APIs.\n\nPatients & TPAs (medical insurers) who gain auditable and verifiable medical records.\n\nResearch institutions (like NSUT and C4GT pilots) leveraging Filecoin storage for clinical trials and public health data pipelines.",
