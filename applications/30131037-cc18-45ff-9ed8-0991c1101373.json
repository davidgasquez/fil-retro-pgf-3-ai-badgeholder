  "description": "JZFS is an open-source, cloud-native version control filesystem based on Git protocol for data management and publication with a command line interface and a Python API. With JZFS, you can version control arbitrarily large data, share or consume data, manage research dataset, collaborate on data, record your data’s provenance, and work computationally reproducible.\n\nJZFS adapts principles of open-source software development and distribution to address the technical challenges of data management, data sharing, and digital provenance collection across the life cycle of digital objects.\n\nCompared with code in software development, data tend not to be as precisely identified because data versioning is rarely or only coarsely practiced. Scientific computation is not reproducible enough, because data provenance, the information of how a digital file came to be, is often incomplete and rarely automatically captured. Last but not least, in the absence of standardized data packages, there is no uniform way to declare actionable data dependencies and derivative relationships between inputs and outputs of a computation. JZFS aims to solve these issues by providing streamlined, transparent management of code, data, computing environments, and their relationship.\n\nJZFS‘s central use case is the Data Hub-and-Spoke Model integrating JZFS and Filecoin (Like Github, buf for Data) to advancing Open Science/AI/Research which essentially consists of a Git version control for data and a Git collaboration for data.\n\nWebsite: https://github.com/GitDataAI/jzfs",

  "end_user": "The central use case described for JZFS is in research data management.  It is specifically used to collect all metadata for complex scientific experiments, such as those involving MRI, histology, and animal behavior.  A key element is the use of a standardized identifier (like a study ID) within a structured file-naming system, which makes data highly Findable, a core principle of proper data management.\n\nIn preparation for publication, JZFS is used to facilitate data reproducibility by making both raw and processed experimental data publicly available on the project's platform, GitData.AI.",
