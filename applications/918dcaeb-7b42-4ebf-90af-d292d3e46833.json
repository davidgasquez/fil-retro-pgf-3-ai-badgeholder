  "description": "MYRAD is a data marketplace where creators can earn by tokenizing their data. Large companies/startups can buy the data they need through datacoins, rewarding creators for every tx.\n\nRegular users can also speculate on these datacoins, buying into promising datasets early and trading them for profit as demand grows.\n\nStarted building on September 28th this year and won ETHGlobal New Delhi’s Filecoin track\n\nsince then, 40+ users have tested MYRAD during the MVP phase and within 24 hours of the alpha launch, 50+ beta testers joined. over 45 datacoins have been minted and traded.",

  "end_user": "okay so there are 3 types of users we are serving\n\n1. AI Creators & Researchers (kaggle/huggingface ecosystem) –> the same people who build and use datasets finally sit on both sides of the table. A Kaggle or Hugging Face creator uploads a dataset, mints it as a datacoin, and an AI researcher burns that datacoin to download it. Every transaction pays the creator directly, creating a loop, if dataset has demand, it's price will go up\n\n2. General users & Crypto natives –> regular users treat MYRAD like an early-stage launchpad. They buy Datacoins early, speculate on trending datasets, and trade them for profit as it's demand rises. The same way people flip tokens from DeFi trenches, here they trade datasets as financial primitives\n\n3. AI startup or large companies -> a startup building fine tuning pipelines for domain models like medical imaging or fintech risk scoring, integrates with MYRAD to source datasets. also users will be able to contribute their own data to datasets which can be used by companies in need of training data/survey data",
