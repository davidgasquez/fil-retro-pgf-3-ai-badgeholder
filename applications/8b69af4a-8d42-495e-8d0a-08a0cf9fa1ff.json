  "description": "The CalibrationNet Stability Project strengthens the Filecoin ecosystem by providing a robust, stable, and scalable test network (CalibrationNet) for SPs, developers, and protocol contributors. It enables safe upgrade validation, consistent environment testing, and tooling stress-tests before mainnet deployments. Through coordinated QAP (Quality Adjusted Power) scaling, it added hundreds of TiBs in just 12 hours using only five machines.\n\nBy maintaining stable calibration nodes and ensuring upgrade resilience, the project provides repeatable benchmarks and reliable access for community testing and iteration. It’s a foundation layer for innovation, allowing contributors to iterate confidently without risking mainnet disruptions.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "QAP Expansion at pace: Rapid scaling to support heavier testing loads.\n\nCalibration stability: Nodes kept deliberately stable to provide reliable testing targets across upgrades.\n\nUpgrade validation: Every network version (nv) undergoes validation on calibration infrastructure before wider deployment.\n\nDaily monitoring & uptime: The project maintains active monitoring and responsiveness to any node issues or disruptions.",
  "testimonials": "Support for the community: The infrastructure is available to SPs and developers for real-world testing scenarios.",
