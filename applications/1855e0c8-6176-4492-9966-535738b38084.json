  "description": "Cuview is a lightweight alternative to the built-in Curio UI. It provides a unified view of cluster health, machine availability, sealing throughput, storage allocation, and market signals in one responsive console.\n\nBuilt as a static frontend that communicates directly with Curio RPC, it can be deployed anywhere with low maintenance overhead and stays aligned with Curio itself.",
  "additional_impact": "Cuview offers an alternative monitoring interface for Curio, designed to be easy to deploy and maintain. It helps storage providers gain operational visibility with minimal setup, improving accessibility within the Curio ecosystem.",
  "end_user": "Cuview is valuable for storage providers using Curio, offering a lightweight and easy-to-deploy interface for monitoring cluster health, sealing operations, and storage allocation. It provides operational visibility without the complexity of traditional monitoring setups.",
