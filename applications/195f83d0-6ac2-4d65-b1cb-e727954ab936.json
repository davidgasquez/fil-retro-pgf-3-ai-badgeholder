  "description": "boxo-starter-kit is a step-by-step guide for navigating IPFS and Filecoin. While the ecosystem is rich and diverse, its complexity often overwhelms newcomers, becoming a major barrier to entry. This toolkit makes the journey approachable by starting with simple concepts like blocks and CIDs, then gradually introducing advanced concepts like IPNI and trustless gateways.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "The project is designed for newcomers who want to join and learn the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystem. It helps beginners understand the core concepts of content addressing, peer-to-peer networking, and decentralized storage through clear, step-by-step examples. By lowering the entry barrier, it enables new developers and students to quickly gain hands-on experience and start contributing to the ecosystem with confidence.",
  "testimonials": "The project has received 8 stars on GitHub and several positive comments from gosuda community members, who shared that the starter kit greatly helped them begin their journey in IPFS and Filecoin development. It will continue to serve as a valuable reference for many new users in the future as well.",
