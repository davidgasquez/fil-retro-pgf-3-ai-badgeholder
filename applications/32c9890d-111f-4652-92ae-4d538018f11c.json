  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Secured Finance has expanded Filecoin’s economic activity by introducing native on-chain lending, stablecoin issuance, and payment utilities:\n\n1.　$5 M + in total lending transaction volume on FVM. \n\n2. USDFC mainnet TVL > $1.5 M, with 500 K USDFC minted as of September 2025.\n\n3. Enabled cross-chain liquidity routing via Axelar and Squid, allowing USDFC (Filecoin-denominated Stablecoin) to be swapped into other stable and network tokens seamlessly.\n\n3. Increased the velocity of FIL capital within DeFi by integrating iFIL (GLIF) and pFIL (Parasail) as accepted collateral types.\n\n4. Supported real economic use cases such as storage payments through Lighthouse and stable on-chain settlements via the USDFC Payment Gateway (HTTP 402 / EIP-3009).\n\nTogether, these contributions have positioned Filecoin as a viable DeFi and payment infrastructure, not just a data-storage protocol.",

  "description": "Secured Finance is a fully on-chain fixed-income and stablecoin protocol built on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), providing institutional-grade rate markets and stable liquidity for the Filecoin ecosystem.\nSince November 2024, we have officially launched the FIL-backed stablecoin USDFC on FVM (Q2 2025), driving sustainable on-chain payments and liquidity for Filecoin DeFi participants.\nOur lending protocol, deployed on FVM, Arbitrum, and Ethereum, has achieved over $5 M in transaction volume and integrates iFIL (GLIF) and pFIL (Parasail) as collateral.\nWe also partnered with Lighthouse to enable USDFC-based payment utility for decentralized data storage, contributing to Filecoin’s growing on-chain economic activity.\nWe introduced a USDFC Payment Gateway supporting HTTP 402 and EIP-3009, enabling seamless programmable payments across applications. (audit report)\nAs of September 2025, our TVL on FVM exceeds $1.5 M, with 500 K USDFC minted, and our community continues to expand through 95 + community calls and open developer engagement.",
  "additional_impact": "Secured Finance has played a key role in educating and onboarding the Filecoin community into DeFi.\nThrough 95+ community calls, technical research papers (“Auto-Roll”, “Itayose Call Auction”), and open-source documentation, the team has established a foundation for interest-rate markets and on-chain financial literacy within FVM.\n\nThe project also promotes cross-ecosystem collaboration, linking Filecoin to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and other EVM networks — creating one of the first interoperable stablecoin ecosystems backed by FIL.\n\nAs an official sponsor of Filecoin ecosystem Hackathons, Secured Finance actively supports developer innovation. One of the community proposals — integrating HTTP 402 and EIP-3009 for seamless on-chain payments — was rapidly implemented by the team and deployed in production, demonstrating our agility and commitment to open collaboration.\n\nAs of September 2025, Secured Finance continues to show strong community traction and ecosystem engagement:\n\nPoints Program Participants: 73,127\nCommunity Reach: Galxe 260 K followers, X 64k, Discord 43 K, Telegram 17 K.\n\nThese achievements reflect Secured Finance’s consistent progress in scaling on-chain liquidity, user education, and real-world adoption across the Filecoin ecosystem.",
  "end_user": "Secured Finance directly benefits Filecoin ecosystem participants, including:\n\n1. FIL holders such as Storage Providers and OGs, who need access to stable liquidity in USD equivalents to fund hardware, energy, and operations without selling their FIL holdings.\n\n2. DeFi Users and Lenders, who can earn fixed income through the on-chain bond market, diversifying yield exposure on FVM.\n\n3. Developers and dApps, who can use USDFC as a native stablecoin for payments, collateral, and settlements across Filecoin-based applications such as data storage and compute.\n\n4. Ecosystem partners (e.g., Lighthouse, GLIF, Parasail), who leverage USDFC to build real payment and lending use cases that drive on-chain economic activity.\n\nBy launching the FIL-backed stablecoin USDFC on FVM, Secured Finance enables Filecoin to transition from a storage-only network into a fully composable financial layer with sustainable liquidity and native payment rails.",
