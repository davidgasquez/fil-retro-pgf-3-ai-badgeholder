In the past 6 months, working group has brought ecosystem participants into governance and group members have been actively participating in FIP discussions and governance as they did in the https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/554#discussioncomment-5389118, bridging the missing links between core-devs / FF and SPs.",
