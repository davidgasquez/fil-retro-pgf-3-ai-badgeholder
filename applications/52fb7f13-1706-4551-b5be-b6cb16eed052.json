  "description": "Since November 2024, ChainSafe’s Infrastructure team has helped maintain the stability and reliability of Filecoin’s Mainnet and Calibnet networks. Our accessible infrastructure keeps these networks easy to build on and explore. We operate core bootstrap nodes, maintain archival and snapshot services for fast syncs, and run a public faucet for developer testing. With consistently high uptime, these services empower developers, storage providers, and users to grow the network securely and sustainably. Our goal is to remain trusted community pillars for Filecoin builders.",
  "additional_impact": "While Forest led the [FRC-0108](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FRCs/frc-0108.md) initiative, integrating F3 data into regular snapshots, ChainSafe’s Infrastructure team implemented fast finality into our snapshots. Legacy snapshots have been maintained to support users who need to persist non-F3 snapshot ingestion functionality.",
