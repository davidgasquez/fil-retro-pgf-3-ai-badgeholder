  "description": "FIP-100 is a protocol change that removed the Batch Balancer from the Filecoin network. This change significantly streamlined the storage onboarding process, resulting in a 30% reduction in gas costs for Storage Providers",
  "additional_impact": "Links to artifacts that were a result of this work:\n\n- FIP Specification: https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0100.md\n- FIP 100 simulations: https://fip100-79951936690.us-central1.run.app \n- FIP 100 parameter exploration: https://github.com/CELtd/cel/tree/kiran/notebooks/proof_fees",
  "end_user": "The direct end user who benefits from FIP-100 is the Filecoin Storage Provider (SP), with cascading benefits that positively impact the entire Filecoin ecosystem. For Storage Providers, this proposal provides immediate and significant value by simplifying the storage onboarding process. By removing the Batch Balancer and introducing a more predictable per-sector fee, FIP-100 reduces the operational overhead, gas costs, and uncertainty in business planning. This streamlined and more transparent cost structure lowers the barrier to entry for new providers and encourages existing ones to scale, which in turn benefits the entire Filecoin network.",
  "testimonials": "The project's value is demonstrated by its solutions to operational and economic issues previously faced by Storage Providers (SPs) and developers in the ecosystem.\n\nThe FIP's design directly impacts operational costs by removing the batch balancer penalties. This change now allows SPs to use batching and aggregation, an improvement that is estimated to reduce associated gas fees by approximately 30%.\n\nFurthermore, the FIP addresses economic uncertainty by introducing a more predictable fee structure. The fee is now calculated a single time at sector activation, removing previous volatility and making costs significantly more predictable for operators. As a risk management feature, the fee is also subject to a new daily payment cap, which is set at 50% of a sector's expected daily block rewards. This provides a hard ceiling on expenses, protecting SPs from an unpredictable financial downside.",

  "usability_or_infrastructure_impact": "Our research directly informed fundamental improvements to the Filecoin protocol's infrastructure and usability for Storage Providers.\n\nA primary infrastructure improvement was the removal of the Batch Balancer mechanism. This component made efficient operations like batching and aggregation \"cost-ineffective\" at normal base fees. Its removal eliminated the batch fee from PreCommit and ProveCommit operations, which is a major usability enhancement. This change allows Storage Providers to consistently use sector batching and proof aggregation, resulting in an estimated 30% reduction in onboarding gas usage.\n\nThis change was paired with a new Daily Per-Sector Fee, which significantly enhances economic usability. By calculating the fee once at activation based on Quality Adjusted Power and circulating supply , the protocol now offers a \"consistent, predictable daily expense\" instead of the \"unpredictable, spiky costs\" of the past. Finally, our work simplified the core infrastructure by removing unnecessary protocol constraints (like PRE_COMMIT_SECTOR_BATCH_MAX_SIZE ) that limited batch sizes. This simplified the protocol and made the gas mechanism the true constraint on computation",
  "efficiency_increase_impact": "Gas Savings: Always able to use batching and aggregation without batch balancer penalties, reducing gas fees by approximately 30%",
  "performance_impact": "Our work improved Filecoin's system performance by removing bottlenecks at the protocol level, which directly enhanced network throughput and scalability.\n\nBy removing the Batch Balancer,  FIP-100 increased network storage onboarding throughput. Storage Providers are no longer disincentivized from using sector batching and proof aggregation. This allows many more sector operations (like PreCommits) to be processed in a single message, dramatically increasing the number of sectors the network can onboard per block.\n\nGas saving is a consequence of this new efficiency, but the performance improvement is the system's newfound ability to process a higher volume of sector operations more cost-effectively, making the entire network more scalable.",
