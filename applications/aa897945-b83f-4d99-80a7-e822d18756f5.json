  "filecoin_growth_impact": "GainForest has catalyzed meaningful growth across multiple dimensions of the Filecoin ecosystem, establishing conservation and climate finance as a viable use case for decentralized storage infrastructure.\n\n1. Network Storage Utilization & Data Economy: 3.7+ TB of high-value conservation data actively stored on Filecoin/IPFS. \n\nThis includes mission-critical environmental intelligence:\n\n- Geospatial datasets mapping conservation areas and ecosystem changes\n- Satellite imagery tracking deforestation, land degradation, and restoration progress\n- Bioacoustics recordings documenting biodiversity and species presence\n- Field monitoring records providing ground-truth verification of conservation activities\n\n2. Financial Transaction Activity: Facilitated $31.3k USD in direct funding to conservation projects since February 2025, flowing through our platform to 45 active initiatives across four continents. While the current volume includes various tokens and stablecoins, this demonstrates early traction in establishing real-world payment rails for environmental finance. \n\n3. Infrastructure & Protocol Development:\n\n- Pioneered hypercerts implementation on Filecoin, creating standardized infrastructure for verifiable impact certificates that can be adopted across the broader regenerative finance (ReFi) ecosystem\n- Developed novel verification mechanisms linking on-chain certificates to off-chain environmental data stored on Filecoin, proving the network's capability for high-stakes, auditable applications\n- Created open-source tooling for data verification and storage that other conservation and climate projects can leverage\n\n4. Ecosystem Credibility & Adoption:\n\n- First web3 project to win an XPRIZE, bringing unprecedented mainstream recognition to Filecoin-based applications and demonstrating that decentralized storage can compete with, and exceed, traditional infrastructure for conservation use cases\n- Onboarded 45 conservation organizations across four continents to web3, many experiencing their first interaction with blockchain technology, expanding Filecoin's real-world adoption beyond crypto-native users\n- Our work establishes a blueprint for how decentralized storage can capture value from sectors that demand permanence, transparency, and global accessibility, expanding Filecoin's total addressable market beyond traditional web3 applications.",

  "description": "GainForest bridges conservation and web3 infrastructure through Ecocertain and Green Globe, empowering nature stewards worldwide to verify conservation efforts, access funding, and preserve critical biodiversity data on Filecoin and IPFS.\n\nSince launch, we've facilitated the storage of 3.7+ TB of conservation data, including geospatial datasets, satellite imagery, and bioacoustics recordings, while enabling 45 projects (through Ecocerts) across four continents to secure $31.3k USD in funding. \n\nOur work achieved a historic milestone as the first web3 project to win an XPRIZE, advancing hypercerts development and demonstrating how permanent, tamper-proof storage can support transparent climate finance for those protecting our planet.",
  "additional_impact": "1. Hypercerts v2 Collaboration\n\nOur engineering team is actively collaborating with the Hypercerts Foundation on the development of Hypercerts v0.2, contributing to the core protocol development through real-world implementation feedback and technical insights from our conservation use cases. This work strengthens the foundational infrastructure for verifiable impact certificates across all sectors, while simultaneously enhancing the verification mechanisms that power our environmental monitoring and certification systems.\n\n2. GG23 Hypercerts for Nature Stewards Round\n\nIn partnership with the Hypercerts Foundation and supported by Celo Public Goods and Ma Earth, we hosted the Hypercerts for Nature Stewards funding round on Gitcoin Grants, our first community-led round featuring a $20,000 matching pool. The round supported 29 land-based conservation, restoration, and regeneration projects, generating $4.1K in total donations from 350 donors. This initiative demonstrated the viability of decentralized conservation funding mechanisms while pioneering innovative approaches to impact evaluation for environmental work.\n\n3. Iceland Research Retreat\n\nWe co-organized a research retreat in Iceland (researchretreat.org), convening builders and researchers to advance decentralized science through collaborative research,  prototyping, and cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange. This retreat catalyzed the development of additional significant public goods initiatives such as a new Gitcoin round on AI for Public Goods (https://gainforest.notion.site/ai4pg)",
  "end_user": "1. Conservation Practitioners – Communities and organizations doing environmental conservation work create Ecocerts representing verified impact (mangrove protection, land restoration, biodiversity preservation). Each Ecocert includes proof of work through geospatial data, satellite imagery, and site boundaries. They receive direct crypto donations to their wallets—peer-to-peer, without intermediaries—enabling real-time funding to scale their projects.\n\n2. Impact Donors – Individuals and organizations seeking transparent, verifiable nature financing. Donors purchase Ecocerts using tokens and stablecoins, with funds flowing directly to conservation projects while receiving permanent, on-chain proof of their impact.\n\n3. Environmental Monitoring & Accountability – Philippine NGO Oceanus Conservation partnered with GainForest to monitor a mangrove restoration site in Cagwait, Philippines. After collecting geospatial data from the field, the conservation area was visualized and tracked on our Green Globe. Through continuous satellite monitoring, the team detected an alarming change: a previously verdant section of the mangrove forest had turned brown on the map.\n\nThe Oceanus team immediately conducted a ground investigation and consulted with local officials, discovering that the trees had been illegally cleared to construct a parking lot without proper environmental permits. The timestamped geospatial data stored on Filecoin provided irrefutable evidence of the violation, enabling Oceanus to advocate for accountability and demonstrate to local authorities the ecological damage in progress.\n\nThis case showcases how permanent, verifiable conservation data empowers environmental justice—giving frontline stewards the tools to detect, document, and challenge illegal activities threatening critical ecosystems in real-time.",
