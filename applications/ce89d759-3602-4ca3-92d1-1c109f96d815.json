  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Eastore contributes by directly enabling and simplifying paid, on-chain storage deals:\n\n1. **For Developers and SPs:** Our tools like [Fil Deal Wrapper](https://github.com/Eastore-project/fil-deal-wrapper) and [ddo-client](https://github.com/Eastore-project/ddo-client) create trustless, automated payment rails, lowering the barrier for developers to build sustainable, paid services on the FVM.  \n2. **For Users:** The [Eastore application](https://eastore.xyz) provides a seamless funnel for non-technical users to deploy capital directly into on-chain storage deals with SPs through Filecoin On-chain Cloud. By abstracting the complexity, we are unlocking a new, broader market of storage users, driving direct demand for the Filecoin network.",

  "description": "Eastore provides a comprehensive suite of utilities that enhances Filecoin storage for developers, SPs, and end-users. From November 2024 to September 2025, we delivered developer CLIs like [Fildeal](https://github.com/Eastore-project/fildeal) and [Eastore-cli](https://github.com/Eastore-project/eastore-cli) for programmatic deal-making, smart contract wrappers ([Fil Deal Wrapper](https://github.com/Eastore-project/fil-deal-wrapper)) for trustless automated payments, and [DDO clients](https://github.com/Eastore-project/ddo-client). This tooling suite culminates in [Eastore](https://eastore.xyz), a privacy-first, drive-like application that abstracts all complexity, offering users client-side encryption, an SP marketplace, and a seamless, Web2-like storage experience on top of Filecoin On-chain Cloud. Our impact is in radically simplifying access for both developers and end-users, making on-chain storage practical and private.",
  "additional_impact": "Our aim is to make Filecoin easier and more useful to users. All our work is aimed at increasing adoption by solving technical bottlenecks and improving the user experience. We also contribute to the core stack through FIP discussions, etc.\n\nBeyond this, our primary impact is in **bridging the gap from low-level developer tooling to a high-level user application, all focused on on-chain storage with privacy.** We didn't just build one piece; we built everything from the low-level CLI tools for programmatic deals ([ddo-client](https://github.com/Eastore-project/ddo-client)) to the high-level user application ([Eastore](https://eastore.xyz)).\n\nWe also try our best to cater to privacy and simplify UX in our work, with client-side encryption integrated at both the CLI and UI levels. This makes Eastore a vital toolkit for applications and users who require true data sovereignty and zero-knowledge storage, a critical need for the future of the decentralized web.",
  "end_user": "Our project benefits two core groups:\n\n1. **Developers & Storage Providers:** Developers in the Filecoin ecosystem use our CLIs ([Fildeal](https://github.com/Eastore-project/fildeal), [Eastore-cli](https://github.com/Eastore-project/eastore-cli), [ddo-client](https://github.com/Eastore-project/ddo-client)) and smart contract wrappers to programmatically manage data, automate paid deals, and integrate on-chain storage into their own applications. SPs also benefit from our [ddo-sp](https://github.com/Eastore-project/ddo-sp) server, which simplifies interaction with paid DDO clients.  \n2. **End-Users:** Non-technical users benefit from the [Eastore drive application](https://eastore.xyz). It provides a \"Google Drive\" style interface to securely store and share files on Filecoin On-chain Cloud, with complex features like client-side encryption and SP selection made easy.",
  "testimonials": "We have received significant and consistent positive feedback directly from developers and teams in the Filecoin ecosystem. This feedback, often via DMs and IRL conversations, etc, repeatedly highlights how our tools have tangibly simplified their development workflow and opened up new, practical ways to use Filecoin for on-chain storage.",
