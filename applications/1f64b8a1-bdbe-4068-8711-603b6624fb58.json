  "description": "Over the past year, Forest has matured into a viable alternative for an increasing number of use cases. The [Common Node API](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FRCs/frc-0104.md), spearheaded by the Forest team, as well as the Ethereum API, was implemented and offers a significant performance advantage for many workloads while maintaining compatibility with Lotus for ease of switching. \n\nForest led the [FRC-0108](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FRCs/frc-0108.md) initiative, integrating F3 data into regular snapshots, which positively impacted the entire network and facilitated Fast Finality adoption. They are the official snapshots powering new nodes since NV27. \n\nSeveral features related to archival data handling were implemented, facilitating the backing up of precious Filecoin data for archival nodes.",
  "additional_impact": "Forest project, due to being implemented in Rust, is contributing significantly to other OSS projects, both in and outside the Filecoin ecosystem, such as FVM, `rust-libp2p` and others. \n\nForest team members are active maintainers of the FVM and builtin-actors repositories, introducing new features, maintaining the code, and implementing FIPs.",
