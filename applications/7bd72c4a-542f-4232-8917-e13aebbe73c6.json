  "description": "This project was aimed to create a highly usable, highly functional system for managing Root Key Holder activity, as well as speed up the governance of Fil+. While the impact was on a small group of people, the outcomes were significant. In the process of building apply.allocator.tech we have also made a major breakthrough - we have created a system long longed for in Filecoin community that allows the Root Key Holders to be represented by multisigs. So now, every organization that was nominated to be the RKH, can have individual multisigs with their own signing power which increases security, resiliency and reliability. The fact that we have managed to create this system in a reproducable way allows teams in Filecoin ecosystems create other similar structures that maintain the voting power by organizations while spreading the load internally.",
  "additional_impact": "This work created a reusable governance pattern for multisig-based decision systems across Filecoin.\nThe success of the RKH msig-of-msigs architecture proves that complex on-chain governance coordination is achievable and secure—laying the foundation for future DAO-style governance and automated compliance in the Filecoin ecosystem.",
  "end_user": "The primary users are Root Key Holders and the Fil+ governance team.\nIndirectly, the entire Filecoin ecosystem benefits through faster DataCap issuance, more reliable decision-making, and greater transparency in governance execution.",
  "testimonials": "The project has received strong informal feedback across Fil+ Slack, governance calls, and GitHub discussions.\nEvery RKH organization involved expressed surprise and excitement that the system worked—solving what had been considered a technically unsolvable coordination problem.\nWhile not measured in formal reviews, all Root Key Holder organizations and members of the Filecoin Foundation acknowledged the milestone as a major leap forward in Fil+ governance automation.",

Causing RKH to share wallets, being in continuous worry what happens if a wallet is lost or a person leaves the organization. \nWith the new system, organizations can now participate safely through their internal multisigs, enabling distribution of responsibility and inclusion of legal, operational, and technical stakeholders.\nThe unified apply.allocator.tech portal further democratized participation by standardizing Allocator onboarding—115 new allocators onboarded and 20 refreshed—through a transparent, self-serve workflow accessible to anyone meeting Fil+ criteria.",
