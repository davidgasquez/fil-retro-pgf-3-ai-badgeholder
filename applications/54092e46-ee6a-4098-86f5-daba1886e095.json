  "description": "Helia, a modular TypeScript implementation of IPFS, supports verifiable data retrieval from storage providers like Filecoin SPs in both NodeJS and browser environments. Features like verified-fetch and service-worker-gateway allow users to pull IPFS content in browser-friendly ways and is leading the way towards enabling a more native IPFS browser experience.",
  "additional_impact": "Some high impact projects Helia supports:\n- Storacha / web3.storage (well known on ramp of data into Filecoin)\n- inbrowser.link (decentralized browser-based IPFS gateway)\n- explore.ipld.io (tool for examining IPLD data as well as a learning tool for those new to IPLD, IPFS, etc.)\n- OrbitDB https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb (peer-to-peer distributed database)\n\nHelia's powering of inbrowser.link and verified-fetch and other browser compatible tooling is particularly important as a way of bringing verifiability, resiliency and configurability to end users that are not inclined to install a separate IPFS application like kubo.\n\nHelia is also a major driver behind other libraries that it depends on. The most obvious of these is js-libp2p the majority of which was developed by the Helia developers over the last several years (and which has not applied as a separate application to this round).\n\nOne of Filecoin’s selling points is in being able to improve applications via p2p tooling at both the storage layer (i.e. resilient and decentralized verifiable storage) and the blockchain layer (i.e. resilient and decentralized verifiable database and execution layer). Ultimately, we need the kinds of improvements driven by Helia to make more of Filecoin's unique capabilities usable within the web platform (the most widely deployed application platform) instead of being stuck for compatibility reasons with combining the brittleness of web2 infrastructure with complexity and newness of web3 infrastructure.",
  "end_user": "Helia directly benefits developers and users of decentralized web applications built on IPFS. JavaScript and TypeScript are dominant languages, particularly for web development, and Helia brings native IPFS capabilities directly to that ecosystem.\n\nHaving the tools to enable a native IPFS experience on the web without requiring pre-installed external tools is a major part in how we can grow the ecosystem and bring the native benefits of IPFS and Filecoin to users more easily. Additionally, being accessible to JS and TS developers makes it easier to attract developers to the ecosystem that will build dApps and other applications on top of IPFS and Filecoin.\n\nA major benefit of Helia is that it reduces the ecosystem’s dependence on centralized gateways (e.g. ipfs.io and dweb.link) and supports projects like inbrowser.link and verified-fetch, which are being developed with the goal of ultimately replacing a huge amount of centralized gateway usage with a more verifiable, resilient, cost effective, and decentralized alternative.",
  "testimonials": "Helia has 1.2k stars on GitHub and is the IPFS implementation used by those in the JS/TS ecosystem.",

  "how_many_dependents": "Most FVM projects do not directly depend on Helia. FVM tools that result in storing data with Filecoin SPs for the purpose of making them available to IPFS mainnet do benefit from Helia though. For example, FilecoinPin https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin/ leverage Helia to work with IPFS data and browser based tooling like the service worker IPFS gateway at https://inbrowser.link can be used to retrieve data from SPs.",
