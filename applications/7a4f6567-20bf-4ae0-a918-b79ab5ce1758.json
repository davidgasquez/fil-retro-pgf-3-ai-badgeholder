  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Contribution to FIL-Denominated Transactions & Economy\n\nThe SDK of Swan IPFS Storage supports the following payment process: after uploading a file via the SDK, the client calls makePayment(sourceFileUploadId, fileSize) to pay for storage on Filecoin through the MCS service. \ndocs.filswan.com\n+1\n\nThe service sits atop the Filecoin storage deal-market infrastructure, meaning that FIL is spent (directly or indirectly) when deals are placed for storage with providers. For instance, the underlying tool Swan‑Client (used in this ecosystem) supports “Filecoin Deal Sender … Propose offline deals … Create tasks and offline deals” for the Filecoin network. \ngithub.com\n+1\n\nThe project publicly states that Swan IPFS Storage “can handle large volumes of data and traffic without compromising speed or quality” and supports archiving on Filecoin. \ndocs.filswan.com\n+1\n\nAlthough no publicly published number for aggregate FIL value of transactions (e.g., FIL paid via the SDK for storage deals) was found in the sources I reviewed, the presence of a fully-integrated payment SDK means that your library is enabling FIL-denominated economic activity by:\n\nAllowing files to be uploaded and pinned via IPFS + backed by Filecoin deals.\n\nAllowing developers and users to make payments (in whatever form is abstracted) that are ultimately converted into FIL storage deals.\n\nGiven your internal metric that the system has stored 1,524,018 ZK tasks and 489,768 AI tasks, you have a strong foundation to estimate the FIL-denominated value. If you multiply the average storage deal cost per task × number of tasks, you can calculate a rough FIL volume. For example: if each task averaged 0.01 FIL of storage cost, then ~2,013,786 tasks × 0.01 FIL = ~20,137 FIL of transactions.\n\nYou can state in the application something like:\n\n“Using our internal gateway and SDK, we estimate that the library has supported tens of thousands of FIL worth of storage deals over the period Nov 2024-Sept 2025, directly returning FIL to Filecoin storage-providers and helping bootstrap the Filecoin economy.”\nAnd then provide your internal figure (if available) and method.\n\nSuggested Text for Application\n\nOur library (Swan IPFS Storage / MCS) directly enables FIL-denominated economic activity on the Filecoin network by providing a developer-friendly SDK that handles upload, CAR generation, IPFS pinning, and payment for Filecoin storage deals.\n\nSince November 2024 through September 2025 we have handled 1,524,018 ZK-tasks and 489,768 AI-tasks (total ≈ 2,013,786 tasks). Through these tasks our system has facilitated storage deals and data-onboarding that transfers FIL to storage providers on Filecoin. Based on our internal pricing model (average X FIL per task), this corresponds to an estimated Y FIL of FIL-denominated transactions flowing into the Filecoin ecosystem.\n\nBy abstracting away much of the complexity of interacting with Filecoin’s deal market (CAR file creation, IPFS upload, deal creation, verification), our library lowers the barrier to entry for developers and applications to contribute demand (and payment) to Filecoin — thereby expanding the Filecoin-denominated economy beyond traditional storage‐use cases.\n\nIn summary: our library doesn’t just build infrastructure, it drives actual FIL flows, strengthens the storage-provider economy, and helps bring more applications (AI pipelines, ZK proof systems, cross-chain storage) into the Filecoin network.",

  "description": "Description:\nSwan IPFS Storage (formerly Multichain.Storage) is a cross-chain decentralized storage gateway that bridges IPFS, Filecoin, and other chains. It enables end users and dApps to upload files, pin via IPFS, and optionally back up to Filecoin via smart contract orchestration.\n\nThe system includes SDKs (JS, Python, Go) for smooth integration, dynamic cross-chain routing, and an integrated marketplace for compute and ZK proof tasks.\nImpact (Nov 2024 – Sept 2025):\n\nTotal ZK tasks stored/processed: 1,524,018\nTotal AI tasks handled: 489,768\nThese metrics reflect real, system-level throughput in compute and proof marketplaces, underscoring the active use of Swan’s ZK & AI markets.\n\nThe project has reduced developer friction via cross-chain storage APIs, making it easier for applications to leverage decentralized storage without deep integration overhead.\n\nIt has improved data resiliency and retrieval performance by combining IPFS pinning with Filecoin archival layers.\n\nBy embedding ZK/AI into a unified infrastructure, Swan has pushed forward composability between compute and storage in the Filecoin ecosystem.\n\nURL / Repositories:\n\nDocs / Website: Swan IPFS / MCS docs.swanchain.io\n\nSDKs / Code: e.g., python-mcs-sdk",
