  "description": "Like Boost, Droplet is Filecoin's pioneering Deal as a Service (DaaS) platform that empowers 13% of the network's active SPs by managing deals and retrievals across distributed nodes. Droplet's recent releases have delivered multiple feature updates and optimizations, including smart contract DDO support, batch release of order collateral, configurable monitoring metrics via Spark interface, payload CID integration in DDO tables for enhanced retrieval and auditing, and datacap renewal function optimization. These comprehensive updates have significantly improved order publishing, collateral management, monitoring and filtering capabilities, and batch operation efficiency.",
  "additional_impact": "N/A",
  "end_user": "Venus SPs are the end users who benefit from these improvements. SPs can now publish DDO orders through Client smart contracts, enabling gradual DataCap allocation based on actual usage to meet Allocator requirements. The update allows SPs to release collateral from expired built-in market orders in batch, significantly improving capital utilization. It provides granular order metrics to analyze retrieval rates at the miner level, compensating for current IPNI limitations. The addition of the payload_cid field to the DDO order table with update commands facilitates easier order retrieval and auditing. A new miner-specific order filtering system in configuration files enables fine-grained control over order acceptance policies, improving order quality and resource matching. The new parameter in DataCap renewal commands prevents message overflow by controlling orders per transaction, increasing on-chain success rates.",
  "testimonials": "The upgrade received a warm welcome from the Venus community https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/CEHHJNJS3/p1758596791887069, especially within the Chinese channel https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C028PCH8L31/p1758596786192719.\nThe new Droplet feature enables Fil+ Allocators to distribute DataCap through smart contracts.
