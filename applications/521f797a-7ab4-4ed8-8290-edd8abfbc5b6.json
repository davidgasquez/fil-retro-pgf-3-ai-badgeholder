  "description": "ETHAccra 2025 is a builder-focused education and hackathon program that advances open-source development and decentralised storage literacy in West Africa. Over a four-day event, it gathered 400 attendees across Builders’ Day and the main hackathon, including 250 hackers who built over 60 projects spanning DeFi, public goods, and data storage use cases. Through Filecoin learning tracks, hands-on workshops, and on-site mentorship, ETHAccra introduced first-time developers to verifiable storage, data permanence, and ecosystem integration, thereby bridging local innovation with global infrastructure.",
  "additional_impact": "ETHAccra 2025 positioned decentralised storage as the core digital infrastructure within West African developer education. By merging research, policy, and builder culture, it seeded a recurring learning pipeline for open-data and blockchain collaboration, ensuring Filecoin remains a foundational layer in Africa’s emerging Web3 landscape.",
  "end_user": "Primary beneficiaries are university-level and early-career developers in Ghana and West Africa seeking technical entry points into decentralized ecosystems. ETHAccra equips them with practical skills in Filecoin, smart contract design, and data storage APIs. Secondary beneficiaries include educators, civic-tech startups, and NGOs integrating decentralized storage into transparency, research, and education use cases.",
  "testimonials": "ETHAccra 2025 participants praised the Filecoin track for its clarity and relevance to real-world problems.\n\n90 % rated technical workshops “very useful.”\n\n85 % expressed interest in continuing to build on decentralized-storage tech.\nTestimonials and social proof: https://lu.ma/ethaccra\n | https://twitter.com/ethaccra",
