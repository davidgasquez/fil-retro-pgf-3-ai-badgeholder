  "filecoin_growth_impact": "The Eth Transport (Transport DAO) project has directly contributed to the growth of the Filecoin economy by enabling real-world, FIL-denominated workflows, promoting developer adoption, and fostering ecosystem interoperability across civic and mobility domains.\n\nOur suite of developer tools, deployed on Filecoin EVM (FVM) and integrated through Storacha, Filecoin and IPFS, powers verifiable incident reporting, billing, and data storage across civic and enterprise pilots. The system supports FIL-based smart contract payments, data archiving, and on-chain DAO coordination.\n\nTransaction Volume: Our tools have supported Filecoin payments in recurring activity through linked workflows such as billing, subscription payments, and civic data storage [1].\n\nCommunity Testing & FVM Contribution: We actively enabled community testing of deploying mobility smart contracts on FVM, providing early feedback on burner bridge issues and address compatibility (ff1–f4 formats) on MetaMask. These contributions were positively received by the FIL-B engineering team, helping refine developer onboarding and tooling stability for FVM users. Please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17P13sh8Hv179FsGhqCxGMiV-I1GpxV99?usp=drive_link . We have also expanded awareness of Filecoin On-chain cloud, Synapse SDK and decentralized identity models in government contexts. Please visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jC0BHwzQ4c\n\nEarly Adopters of Filecoin Eco-system Innovations: We are early adopters of the Federated Learning initiative led by py-libp2p contributors, leveraging Akave as a decentralized storage layer for privacy-preserving data collaboration. We are also early adopters of the ETH–FIL Swap product using the 1inch Fusion+ SDK, reinforcing Filecoin’s interoperability with Ethereum. Please visit https://incident-dapp-filecoin.vercel.app/  & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgClO4wZ7iw \n\nEcosystem Growth: By connecting Filecoin’s decentralized storage with IoT and mobility applications, Eth Transport expands the Filecoin economy into new domains like smart cities, transport analytics, and government collaboration, driving sustained FIL-denominated use cases.\n\nOur goal remains to make Filecoin a trusted backbone for civic and enterprise data infrastructure, creating real economic activity while improving developer experience and interoperability across the Filecoin stack.\n\n[1] Earnings share in Filfox bulk transactions: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ziey1FyD1IFW4k9xJwTlkZwRq8TJvPG7?usp=drive_link",

  "description": "Eth Transport has evolved from a Filecoin Microgrant project into a production-grade decentralized incident management and civic coordination suite. \n\nBetween November 2024 and September 2025, it integrated Storacha & UCANs, and piloted the use of cross chain bridges with Celo & Self Protocol, Kadena and Hedera with Storacha storage protocol, and Filecoin warm storage with Synapse SDK  to enable blockchain-verified road incident reporting, civic data management, and DAO-based coordination for public authorities.\n\nThe project demonstrates Filecoin’s strength as a trust anchor for government and public infrastructure. Deployed in collaboration with industry partners like  Logix Junction &  MACQ, Code for Gov Tech & NSUT, Government of NCT of Delhi; it enables citizens, police, and mobility officers to create and verify on-chain records backed by decentralized storage. The open-source modules have become reference implementations for civic data DAOs and real-world Filecoin adoption.",
  "additional_impact": "Eth Transport demonstrates how Filecoin and IPFS can underpin transparent, civic-grade infrastructure for cities worldwide. It has:\n\nEncouraged cross-protocol interoperability (Filecoin ↔ Storacha ↔ Celo).

Please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1miVjRm7o0FVcQwK8cIvJJ3lwHOYhBGex?usp=drive_link \n\nBy making public data verifiable, modular, and citizen-owned, Eth Transport extends Filecoin’s mission of building public-good infrastructure for humanity’s information.",
  "end_user": "Eth Transport benefits a diverse ecosystem spanning civic authorities, public institutions, researchers, and Web3 developers building on the Filecoin stack.\n\nCivic Stakeholders – City and traffic authorities, police departments, and urban planners use the platform to record, verify, and coordinate road incident data through Filecoin-powered storage and IPFS-verified records.\n\nEducational & Research Institutions – Government universities such as NSUT (Delhi) use Eth Transport as a learning and deployment tool for training engineers in FEVM, decentralized data storage, and on-chain governance and cross chain interoperability using Celo, Kadena, Hedera with Storacha hot storage layer.\n\nIndustry Collaborators – Organizations like MACQ, ZF Mobility , NXP Semiconductors, and Tech Swarm (India) leverage Eth Transport’s data DAO modules, UAV monitor stack, and interoperability bridges with Storacha for real-world deployments.\n\nDevelopers & Data Engineers – Through open APIs, SDKs, and FEVM integrations, developers across the Filecoin ecosystem use Eth Transport to build civic tools, automate data pipelines, and explore cross-chain workflows with Ethereum, Celo & Self Protocol, Hedera, Chainlink, Polygon, Kadena and Optimism.\n\nTogether, these users form a connected civic-tech and developer ecosystem using Filecoin as a foundational layer for transparency, accountability, and verifiable data sharing in urban mobility.",
  "testimonials": "Eth Transport has received 7+ positive testimonials from ecosystem and institutional partners:\n\nFilecoin & IPFS Microgrants Team for demonstrating verifiable civic use cases.\n\nC4GT mentors and PLDG Stewards for advancing decentralized governance pilots.\n\nNSUT (Delhi Government) for real-world testing in academic–government collaboration.\n\nStoracha and OrbitDB maintainers for bridging decentralized storage with live civic data streams.\n\nMoralis Hackathon jury recognized Eth Transport with Filecoin, Fluence, XMTP, and Ledger prizes for applied innovation.\n\n📄 References:\n\n[1] Consulting assignments and Testimonials for Eth Transport: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xeQlXwGlpwDwFymzbXM7NzoCPqm1QhFL?usp=drive_link\n\nGitHub Discussion: Filecoin Community #744 (please visit https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/744#discussioncomment-14602573)\n\nYouTube Demo Overview(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2iYxQCuaI)",
