  "filecoin_growth_impact": "By automating and securing the delivery of Curio’s GPU builds, the APT repository has enabled faster deployment of nodes participating in the Filecoin proving economy. It directly supports FIL-denominated compute markets by ensuring reliability and accessibility for new GPU contributors, thus lowering entry barriers and expanding the network’s active computational supply.",

  "description": "The Curio APT Repository delivers official Debian and Ubuntu packages for GPU-accelerated Filecoin software, including Curio builds with CUDA and OpenCL support. It enables one-line installation, version control, and automatic updates - removing the complexity of manual compilation. By maintaining a secure, signed APT repo under the Filecoin Project, Curio ensures developers and operators can deploy high-performance compute nodes consistently across clusters, strengthening Filecoin’s technical infrastructure and network scalability.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "The APT repository benefits Filecoin storage providers, node operators, GPU compute contributors, and developers building on Curio or Filecoin. It simplifies deployment and maintenance of Curio software on Linux-based systems, ensuring stable upgrades, dependency management, and reproducibility. This lowers technical barriers for small operators while improving operational efficiency for large-scale deployments.",
  "testimonials": "The Curio APT Repository is actively used and referenced by ecosystem contributors and operators who rely on Curio’s compute stack. It has received positive feedback through GitHub discussions, particularly around simplifying installation and build management.\nLinks:\n- 📦 https://github.com/filecoin-project/apt\n- 📘 https://docs.curiostorage.org\n- 💻 https://curiostorage.org",
