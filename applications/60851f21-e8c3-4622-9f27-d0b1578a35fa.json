  "end_user": "Storacha Onchain Payments is an open-source, multi-chain proof-of-concept for decentralized, pay-as-you-go storage payments.\n\nThe Solana SDK (Phase 1) enables per-upload payments in native SOL with UCAN-based storage delegation and linear escrowed rewards for providers, supporting pure crypto-native billing and Solana Mobile dapp integration.\n\nIn 2025, the project expanded to Filecoin (Phase 2) with USDFC-based per-file payments on the Filecoin Calibration Testnet, integrating Synapse SDK for warm storage, UCAN delegation, and escrow-based release after storage confirmation.\n\nStoracha brings simple, programmable payment flows for decentralized storage and aims to make Filecoin storage as easy to access as any modern cloud API — powered entirely by on-chain settlement.",
