  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Axelar has been pivotal in scaling Filecoin’s on-chain economic footprint by enabling:\n1. Cross-chain stablecoin mobility allowing USDFC and FIL-backed assets to flow into 80+ chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Sui, XRPL, and Stellar.\n\n2. Liquidity inflow through Axelar + Squid, Filecoin projects now access external liquidity pools, stablecoin markets, and DeFi protocols seamlessly.\n\n3. Composable token infrastructure via ITS enables FVM tokens to gain instant cross-chain representation and usability.\n\n4. Unified developer access with Axelar SDKs and APIs simplifies multi-chain integration for Filecoin dApps.\n\n\nThrough these contributions, Axelar effectively makes Filecoin a liquidity-connected network, where capital, users, and applications can circulate freely between ecosystems.  As of October 2025, over $54 million in cumulative cross-chain volume has been processed through Axelar.",

  "description": "Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication and liquidity connectivity to the Filecoin ecosystem through its General Message Passing (GMP) and Interchain Token Service (ITS) infrastructure.\n\nBy integrating Filecoin into Axelar Network, Filecoin builders, dApps, and token issuers can access global liquidity, external assets, and interoperable user bases across 80+ supported ecosystems such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Sui, XRPL, Stellar, IBCs, and more.\n\nSince launching Filecoin–Axelar connectivity, Axelar has provided secure routes for USDFC, USDC, FIL, and other ecosystem assets to flow across chains, allowing Filecoin-native DeFi applications to tap into global capital and liquidity.\n\nThis connectivity empowers projects like Secured Finance and FILLiquid to expand beyond FVM, bridging stablecoins and governance tokens seamlessly into and out of Filecoin.\n\nAxelar’s infrastructure has been audited by leading firms including Halborn, Ackee, and Ottersec, ensuring the highest institutional-grade security and reliability for cross-chain interoperability.\n\nAs of October 2025, over $54 million in cumulative cross-chain volume has been processed through Axelar, with Filecoin now positioned as an active DeFi and liquidity participant in the broader multi-chain economy.",

  "end_user": "Axelar’s integration directly benefits multiple stakeholder groups within the Filecoin ecosystem:\nDevelopers and dApps – gain access to 80+ ecosystems via a single SDK, enabling other ecosystem protocols to bridge assets and liquidity into Filecoin via ITS and Filecoin-based projects can gain data from external networks using Axelar GMP.\n\n\n1. Token Issuers and Projects can issue Filecoin-native assets such as FIL-backed stablecoins or staking derivatives and make them tradable and usable across other chains without deploying new contracts.\n\n2. Filecoin DeFi Users can access external yield sources, cross-chain swaps, and liquidity pools directly from FVM through Squid and other GMP-powered interfaces.\n\n3. Ecosystem Partners such as Secured Finance, Filliquid, and GLIF, who leverage Axelar connectivity to expand their utility and liquidity beyond Filecoin.\n\n4. End Users – who benefit from smooth, secure, and affordable cross-chain transactions, bridging Filecoin’s storage economy with the wider on-chain world.\n\n5. By connecting Filecoin with external DeFi and liquidity networks, Axelar effectively transforms Filecoin into an interoperable financial and data layer, not just a storage network.",
  "testimonials": "Axelar has received strong endorsement and adoption from multiple leading builders in the Filecoin ecosystem:\n\n1. Secured Finance integrated Axelar’s GMP and Squid to route USDFC stablecoin liquidity across Filecoin, Ethereum, and Arbitrum.\n\n2. GLIF uses Axelar ITS to extend iFIL composability into cross-chain DeFi protocols.\n\n3. Lighthouse is leveraging Axelar GMP for stable, programmable payments tied to decentralized storage activity.\n\n4. Parasail is exploring cross-chain liquidity for pFIL collateral and staking derivatives through Axelar’s interoperability layer.\n\nTogether, these collaborations demonstrate Axelar’s instrumental role in bringing Filecoin-based liquidity, payments, and assets into the global DeFi ecosystem.",
