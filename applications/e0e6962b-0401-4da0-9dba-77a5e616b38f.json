  "end_user": "The primary end users who benefit from this project are students, developers, and local tech communities. These groups are at the heart of the initiative's efforts to expand awareness and practical expertise in decentralized storage, the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), and blockchain applications.\nStudents: Our university-focused programs have been highly impactful. The FVM Campus Tour, (FilecoinCode n' Corgi ) detailed in https://x.com/FilecoinNigeria/status/1955317031089131747, engaged over 200 students across three universities, teaching them to build decentralized applications (DApps) and deploy smart contracts on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). Additionally, university meetups (https://x.com/FilecoinNigeria/status/1911878655111725392 and https://x.com/FilecoinNigeria/status/1913514897423425738) introduced over 402 students to Filecoin and FVM, generating nearly 4,000 impressions on X, showcasing their active participation.\n\nDevelopers: Hands-on workshops have empowered developers with practical skills. The Building on FVM Bootcamp 20+ participants with live demos on deploying sites and storing data on Filecoin, while the AI and Decentralized Storage Meetup and AI Agents Workshop  united 45+ developers to build AI agents powered by Filecoin, fostering technical expertise.\n\nLocal Tech Communities: Our grassroots initiatives, as seen in https://x.com/Divine_Vessel/status/1912272760564228197 and https://x.com/FilecoinNigeria/status/1911719704059670530, have strengthened local tech ecosystems through community gatherings and mentorship, exemplified by the collaborative workshop environment in https://x.com/FilecoinNigeria/status/1912294447422799977.\nThis setting, with participants coding and engaging with educational content like the \"Smart Contracts + Possibilities\" poster, highlights the inclusive community focus.\nThis ongoing effort continues to drive innovation and skill development within Nigeria’s tech landscape, as evidenced by our recent activities and community engagement.",
