  "filecoin_growth_impact": "As the primary hub for DEX liquidity, Oku Trade through its associated v3 pools account for ~3.5% of Filecoin’s TVL and 66% of DEX liquidity. It’s paramount to the ecosystem to focus on increasing DEX liquidity and decrease the reliance of CEX’s that hold the vast majority of FIL’s available supply.\n\nAs a swap & bridge aggregator, Oku provides efficient and reliable routes for users with assets on other EVM chains to engage in Filecoin’s ecosystem to either accrue yield through LP’ing or liquid staking/restaking protocols such as Parasail or GLIF.",

  "description": "Oku has been an integral part of the Filecoin ecosystem since February 2024, receiving two grants to further support the network through an all-in-one interface for liquidity management, token swaps, and seamless bridging to and from Filecoin — all with zero fees for end users. By enhancing accessibility and liquidity flow, Oku has helped increase transaction volume and broaden participation across the Filecoin DeFi landscape.",
  "additional_impact": "In October 2023, Oku received an initial grant to support the deployment of the Filecoin network on oku.trade. This unlocked access to the full suite of services, including swapping, bridging, LP management, and robust analytics. Fast forward to March 2025, and another grant was issued from the OIF to continue maintaining the deployment. \n\nOku.trade was also included in the Round 1 of Filecoin’s RetroPGF, receiving 2512 FIL\n\nhttps://www.fil-retropgf.io/archive/round-1/0x6ea5475e579085525a029f55373e13a243e69acf4da808a15618ac841e4e84c8.html\n\nOku isn't a massive VC-backed project. We haven't monetized the user interface. Any support in funding the project is greatly appreciated.",
  "end_user": "Any user who needs to bridge or swap tokens on Filecoin can do so via Oku. Popular pools such as celerWETH/WFIL - 0.05% and celerUSDC/WFIL - 0.3% are seeing a steady increase in 7-day trading volume, up 473% and 91%, respectively. A healthy DEX liquidity environment encourages increased activity on popular liquid restaking applications like GLIF, Parasail, and STFIL. The vast majority of FIL trading volume comes from major T1/T2 CEX’s. It’s Oku’s aligned mission to see the growth of Filecoin’s DeFi ecosystem through deep DEX liquidity.\n\nAs a 0% fee swap & bridge aggregator, Oku is the best place for users to trade tokens in the Filecoin ecosystem. Utilize Squidrouter and direct swapping with Uniswap v3 pools to guarantee you get the best conversion rates.\n\nOku is the easiest place to create pools and manage LP positions. Through this link: https://oku.trade/app/filecoin/liquidity/, users can contribute liquidity and run backtests to evaluate LP performance over a set period. Claiming fees and rewards is also one-click away through our LP management interface.",
  "testimonials": "While Oku is not a developer tool in the Filecoin Ecosystem, we have received many positive reviews and testimonials from repeat users across the broader ecosystem. We have particularly received a wave of feedback over the last two months from recent improvements.",
