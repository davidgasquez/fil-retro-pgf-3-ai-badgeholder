  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Drainer re‑activates stranded FIL (dust) and reduces failed ops caused by fee starvation by keeping working wallets topped and consolidated. Illustrative estimate: 40–100 addresses × 0.01–0.05 FIL residual → ~0.4–5 FIL recovered per sweep per SP. If 50 SPs run it monthly, that re‑activates ~20–250 FIL/month while cutting failed sends and operator time.",

  "description": "Filecoin Drainer is an open‑source shell tool that safely consolidates FIL from many source addresses into a single destination. From Nov 2024–Sep 2025 we’ll harden the two‑step sweep+top‑off flow, add dry‑run/resume, CSV & keystore batch inputs, concurrency with back‑off, automatic gas estimation, and detailed audit logs. The result: operator time drops from hours to minutes, dust balances are recovered, and failed sends from underfunded fees are avoided. Used alongside Lotus/Curio, Drainer keeps market/worker wallets tidy and ready for NV upgrades.",
  "additional_impact": "Operational hygiene and safety: guardrails (gas reserve, no overspend), local‑node requirement, dry‑run mode, resume support, and audit logs. Simplifies treasury ops, reduces manual error, and prepares wallets for NV‑upgrade transitions.",
  "end_user": "Filecoin Storage Providers (ops/treasury teams), custodians of multisig wallets, and anyone consolidating revenues/dust across many addresses.",
  "testimonials": "This is a utility script, not a developer SDK. Adoption is better reflected by repo stars/forks and operator usage.",
