  "filecoin_growth_impact": "By maintaining Boost through NV upgrades and security updates, we keep ~4.37 EiB QA (~19.6%) online and transactable, avoiding deal disruptions, reducing upgrade risk, and preserving retrieval reliability. This continuity sustains FIL-denominated deal volume and protects SP margins during protocol evolution.",

  "description": "Boost is the market daemon powering storage and retrieval deals for a large share of Filecoin. While Curio Market 2.0 is developed, Curio Storage maintains Boost for stability, security, and NV-upgrade compatibility. We validate each Lotus/NV release, ship security/dep updates, run pre-release tests on calibnet/mainnet, and document safe upgrade paths for SPs. Result: uninterrupted deal flow, safer operations, and a smooth path to Curio Market -with zero disruption to clients or providers relying on Boost today.",
  "additional_impact": "•\tDocumented upgrade playbooks and pre-release validation lower operator toil and incident risk.\n•\tSecurity patching across deps/RPC layers reduces attack surface.\n•\tEnsures a smooth migration path to Curio Market 2.0 without downtime for existing clients and SPs.",
  "end_user": "Filecoin Storage Providers (ops/SRE teams) and data clients who rely on stable storage/retrieval markets; plus the broader network during NV upgrades.",
  "testimonials": "Impact is measured by production adoption and uptime across SPs.",
