  "description": "The \"Guide to Filecoin\" project is an open-source educational repository hosted on GitHub. It aims to ease the transition to Filecoin by providing a comprehensive, structured curriculum on decentralized technologies, with a strong focus on Filecoin's role in storage, Web 3.0, and related ecosystems. The content is primarily delivered through a detailed README file that organizes materials into thematic chapters, each linking to video tutorials (often bilingual in English and Chinese) on platforms like YouTube and Bilibili, along with supplementary Google Docs presentations and external web resources.\n\nKey sections include:\n\nFoundational Topics: Coverage of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and the journey to Web 3.0, explaining core concepts like content addressing, peer-to-peer networking, and trustless systems.\nMetaverse Integration: In-depth exploration of metaverse architectures, primitives (e.g., computation, storage via IPFS/Filecoin, NFTs, and DeFi), and opportunities for community-driven development.\nFilecoin-Specific Guides: An \"ELI5\" (Explain Like I'm 5) series simplifying blockchain fundamentals, Filecoin's consensus mechanisms, tokenomics, storage and retrieval markets, becoming a storage provider, and ecosystem overviews, including the 2023 master plan.\nPractical Development: Tutorials on coding with Filecoin, such as using Lotus nodes, storing NFTs and data via NFT.storage, building dApps with Moralis and IPFS, and handling large-scale data storage.",
