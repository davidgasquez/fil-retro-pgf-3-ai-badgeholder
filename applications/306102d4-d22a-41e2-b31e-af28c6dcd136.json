  "description": "The Lily project provides essential tooling to extract blockchain data into data dumps, databases, files and other forms accessible by the ecosystem and the wider public. Almost all historical information about the Filecoin blockchain promulgated to the community can ultimately be traced back to Lily. \n\n**Impact and metrics**\n* **Indispensable**: Lily powers nearly all data or information about the Filecoin ecosystem that is ultimately propagated to the public domain\n* **Monitoring Network Health**: Lily powers low latency monitoring of network health and emergency monitoring by Protocol Labs / Filecoin Foundation security team\n* **Reach**: Data is used not only ubiquitously within Filecoin for governance, discussion, talks, and presentations. Our data also ubiquitously appears in the public domain such as Filecoin TLDR and analytics reports by Messari. \n* 49 stars on Github and 47 forks.\n\n**Recent Progress**\n* Expanding coverage to enable miners to track penalties and fees more accurately using a mechanism introduced in FIP-0100\n* Coverage of miner Sector Daily Fee \t\n* Responded to multiple technical support requests, as well as implemented feature requests from core developers and FilOz\n* Added support for data extraction from the Filecoin Virtual Machine",

  "end_user": "Lily’s benefits are felt by virtually every stakeholder in the Filecoin ecosystem. The Filecoin ecosystem uses Lily for network governance, alert & monitoring, analytics, blockchain research, periodic reporting about the network, and so on. Developers, governance teams and analytics teams require Lily to develop insights into network health, which are then distilled and consumed even by casual users.",
  "testimonials": "No direct links to testimonials. The Lily project is one of the oldest and most established projects in the Filecoin ecosystem, and is a “part of the furniture”.",
