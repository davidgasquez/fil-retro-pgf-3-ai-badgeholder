  "description": "Our project provides the critical simulation and analysis for Filecoin's RetroPGF rounds. We model the impact of different round parameters, such as voting thresholds and maximum votes, to ensure the allocation curve aligns with the program's intentions. This work provides a data-driven foundation for the governance process, making it more transparent and accessible to all members of the ecosystem.",
  "additional_impact": "The following links are various non-technical artifacts that have been shared across the Filecoin community and beyond, and they have received many views and comments in and outside of the Filecoin ecosystem.  This is impactful to Filecoin because it raises awareness that builders are rewarded in Filecoin, and therefore \n\n- Round 2 Results Deep-Dive: https://medium.com/cryptoeconlab/a-deepdive-into-fil-retropgf-2-results-880234699fe4\n- Round 1 Results Deep-Dive: https://medium.com/cryptoeconlab/a-deepdive-into-fil-retropgf-1-results-7e5a0bcdba08\n- https://www.cryptoeconlab.com/blog/robustness-voting-methods-conflicts-interest\n- https://www.cryptoeconlab.com/blog/quantitative-rpgf-pairwise-voting-simulation",
  "end_user": "The beneficiaries of this project are both the Filecoin ecosystem and also the broader Web3 community.\n\nInternally, the Filecoin community benefits from a robust, fair, and effective RetroPGF program. Our project provides the simulation and analysis necessary for proper round design. This is needed because it ensures that program funding is distributed fairly and aligns with community-valued impact. By modeling parameters like voting thresholds and allocation curves , we provide a data-driven foundation for the program's governance. This builds trust in the allocation process and ensures that public goods projects important to Filecoin's success are recognized and rewarded.\n\nExternally, our work benefits the broader crypto and public goods communities. The detailed \"deep-dive\" analyses and public modeling make Filecoin's governance process more transparent and accessible to outsiders. This not only raises awareness of the Filecoin ecosystem but also showcases Filecoin's leadership in Collective Governance.",
  "testimonials": "RetroPGF round analysis was well received by the community at large, and the articles have been reshared and read from the source over 100 times. This provides additional positive impact to the Filecoin community since it enables outsides to learn more about the Filecoin ecosystem.",
