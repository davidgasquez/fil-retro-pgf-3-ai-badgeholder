  "description": "go-libp2p is a collection of protocols that support a wide range of functionalities, such as connection establishment, remote node protocol identification and negotiation (through its identify protocol) data encryption, content/peer discovery (through its Kademlia DHT component) and data transfer through its Pub/Sub protocol (GossipSub). go-libp2p powers many networks and applications such as Filecoin (Lotus and Venus), Ethereum (Prysm, Erigon), Optimism (op-node), IPFS (kubo, rainbow, etc.), Celestia (celestia-node) and many more.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "go-libp2p is the networking stack that the Filecoin network, its consensus algorithm and its most widely adopted implementation, Lotus, depend on. It is one of the most critical dependencies of Lotus and Filecoin and without go-libp2p, Lotus would need to develop (and maintain) an entire bespoke networking stack for the P2P layer. Thus, by virtue of using go-libp2p, Lotus, Venus, Curio, Boost, and the Filecoin network can continue to focus on other key business needs and features by relying on the guarantees provided by go-libp2p.\n\nGo-libp2p provides the Filecoin networking stack transports such as TCP, QUIC, WebSocket, WebRTC, WebTransport, and HTTP, it provides secure channels to send data via encryption mechanisms like TLS and Noise. It provides reachability for nodes on private networks via Hole Punching, AutoNat, Circuit Relay mechanisms, and it provides peer to peer gossip capabilities via GossipSub. It provides DoS resiliency and security for the networking layer via resource management capabilities, and much more.",
  "testimonials": "go-libp2p has 6.6k stars on GitHub and powers the Filecoin network, the IPFS network, and many others.",
