  "description": "IPFS Companion is a browser extension that augments browsers with the capability to fetch IPFS data from any source they want. This includes locally run gateways like those in IPFS Desktop which is a desktop application that makes it easy for users to host and retrieve data with IPFS.",
  "additional_impact": "IPFS Companion in particular has been an important tool in shaping how the future of resilient and verifiable data interacts with web browsers and how core IPFS developers interact with major browser vendors today to set us up for that future. Given that one of the most common ways people consume IPFS content today is via their web browsers this is critical to how the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystems consider content delivery longer term. It also shapes the kind of work done in IPFS implementations to ultimately bring as many benefits of IPFS and Filecoin to users as possible while requiring them to install minimal amounts of software based on their needs",
  "end_user": "IPFS Desktop makes working with IPFS data more approachable for individual users who don’t want to work with command line tools or daemons. For many users in the IPFS ecosystem it’s how they interact with IPFS if they’re looking for one layer deeper involvement than asking a public gateway like ipfs.io or dweb.link to pull their data from data providers (e.g. Filecoin SPs or their partners like Lighthouse, Storacha / web3.storage, etc.).\n\nIPFS Companion is a sibling tool that brings a more native IPFS experience to web browsers. It enables users to add verifiability of the IPFS data found in any links they encounter online (e.g. from NFT platforms, blogs, dApps, user facing websites, etc.) even while those platforms are able to make sure their user experience is good (even if relying on the less resiliency guarantees of web 2). In combination with tools like IPFS Desktop it also allows users to backup and store data they encounter on the web locally as well as export that data to storage providers including those that back their data with Filecoin.",

  "how_many_dependents": "Most projects are not themselves strictly dependent on IPFS Desktop / Companion as they are tools that aid IPFS end users in how they want to work with IPFS.\n\nFor example. these tools provide users friendly ways to make their data available to the IPFS network, whether via self-hosting and/or pinning services. Additionally, they bring users the resiliency that comes from more native IPFS retrieval, as compared to needing to rely on a public gateway like ipfs.io or dweb.link.",
