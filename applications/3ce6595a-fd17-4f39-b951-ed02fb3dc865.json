  "description": "The drand team at Randamu has been actively stewarding the League of Entropy, maintaining the drand software that powers it, and provided high-availability HTTP endpoints for Filecoin SPs to get timely drand beacons from the League of Entropy, allowing smooth leader election for the Filecoin Consensus.\n\nBetween November 2024 and September 2025, the team ran 5 so-called \"resharing ceremonies\", ensuring a healthy set of nodes are able to participate in the permissioned network that is the League of Entropy, as well as on-boarded 3 new universities into the League of Entropy: [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en/),  [HSLU](https://www.hslu.ch/en/) and [CUIT](https://english.cuit.edu.cn/).\n\nFurthermore, the HTTP relays ran by the team have consistently delivered over 2.75B beacon requests per month. A great improvement the team has been able to make in the past year has been to significantly reduce the latency of beacon aggregation, from roughly ~700-900ms down to only 150-200ms! \n\n![latency change](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df371e22-35a0-48ac-a438-0fde58b7ff6f)\n\nThis was feasible thanks to extensive profiling and tracing capabilities being implemented in the codebase, leading to great improvement in performances as can be seen on the above figure.",
