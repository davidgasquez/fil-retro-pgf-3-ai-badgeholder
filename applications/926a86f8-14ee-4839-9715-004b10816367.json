  "filecoin_growth_impact": "While Silvi doesn't directly transact in FIL tokens (we use Lighthouse Storage which handles Filecoin deals behind the scenes), we contribute to the Filecoin ecosystem in several critical ways:\n\n**1. Network Utilization & Storage Demand:**\n- **Active Lighthouse customer** since 2023 (paid subscription)\n- **Daily pinning operations** from production users\n\n**2. Demonstrating Real-World Use Cases:**\n- **Biodiversity verification**: Proving IPFS/Filecoin works for climate tech\n- **Geospatial data storage**: Tile-by-tile implementation solves \"big raster problem\"\n- **Enterprise-grade deployment**: Production infrastructure under load\n- **Standards compliance**: STAC API shows IPFS works with existing protocols\n\n**3. Developer Ecosystem Contribution:**\n- **Open-source utilities**: Reusable code for IPFS integration\n- **STAC API pattern**: Geospatial data discovery template\n- **Tile generation pipeline**: Enabling other projects to store rasters on IPFS\n- **Documentation/SDK**: Architecture guide for climate tech builders\n\n**4. Client Acquisition for Filecoin Ecosystem:**\n- **Clients** discovering IPFS/Filecoin for MRV use cases\n- **Researchers** accessing decentralized geospatial archives\n\n**5. Cross-Chain Bridging:**\n- **Blockchain-IPFS integration**: EAS attestations on Celo/Arbitrum pointing to Filecoin-backed CIDs\n- **Payment verification**: $120k+ transactions cryptographically linked to IPFS evidence\n- **Multi-chain interoperability**: Same IPFS data works across networks\n\n**6. Long-Term Data Permanence:**\n- **Multi-year archives**: 2023-2025 time-series data\n- **Change detection**: Before/after orthomosaics proving forest growth\n- **Regulatory compliance**: Permanent audit trails for carbon markets\n- **Knowledge preservation**: Environmental data surviving beyond Silvi's lifetime\n\n**Ecosystem Growth Narrative:**\nSilvi proves IPFS/Filecoin is NOT just for:\n- NFT metadata\n- Simple file storage\n- Proof-of-concepts\n\nBut rather critical infrastructure for:\n- Planetary-scale biodiversity verification\n- Regulatory compliance (carbon markets)\n- Multi-decade environmental archives",

  "description": "Silvi has expanded our IPFS stack (biodiversity and reforestation verification) significantly this year for, and launched a $100,000 campaign during Gitcoin Grants 24 where every transaction is tied to embedded IPFS CIDs on-chain. This year we also built significant geospatial capabilities on IPFS that bring tile-by-tile orthomosaics, satellite data analysis, and improved tree occurence data storage. We have begun adopting a STAC-compliant API exposing assets via IPFS URLs, and dual IPFS pinning for blockchain attestations on Celo/Arbitrum. Lastly, we launched Treekipedia, a tree knowledge engine with IPFS central to our AI-generated synthetic data and raw research. We've proven IPFS/Filecoin as critical infrastructure for planetary-scale reforestation, tracking trees and reforestation data across 5 continents with verifiable GPS, photos, video, claims and evaluations.",

  "end_user": "**Case Study 1: Gitcoin Grants 24 - $100k IPFS-Verified Distribution**\n\nWe just launched launched $100,000 USD across 9 bioregions globally using a plant-to-earn model where every payment is cryptographically linked to IPFS-stored evidence. https://app.silvi.earth/bioregion-round-2025\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. Planter takes photo via mobile app → Automatic IPFS pin (base64 → binary → Lighthouse)\n2. Claim metadata (GPS, species, timestamp) → JSON on IPFS\n3. EAS attestation created on Celo with dual IPFS CIDs (schema + data)\n4. Admin approves claim → Allo Protocol smart contract distributes payment\n5. On-chain transaction includes IPFS CID in transaction data\n\n**Methodology Example** ($4 per tree):\n- Proof of Planting: 60% ($2.40) - requires field photo + GPS\n- Proof of Maturity: 40% ($1.60) - requires 3-month verification photo + GPS\n\n**Impact:**\n- the largest web3 plant-to-earn reforestation campaign\n- 100% of evidence permanently on IPFS\n\n**Case Study 2: Tile-by-Tile Orthomosaic Storage for Change Detection**\n\nA conservation land trust in NZ needed to verify reforestation claims over a 1000-hectare site using drone imagery, but faced the challenge of storing and loading 50GB+ of GeoTIFF files, sometime 750mb per file!\n\n**Our Solution:**\n1. Upload orthomosaic GeoTIFF to Silvi platform\n2. GDAL processes into Web Mercator tiles (zoom 0-22)\n3. Each tile (256x256 pixels) uploaded individually to IPFS\n4. Metadata JSON maps coordinates to IPFS CIDs\n5. Frontend map viewer fetches only visible tiles from IPFS gateway with dynamic range requests, buffering and resolutions.\nCheckout some of this demod here https://x.com/SilviProtocol/status/1977615081476407759\n\nOr better, play around with the data in our app! \nhttps://app.silvi.earth/login\n\n**Results:**\n- 1 orthomosaic → 100-5,000 individual IPFS CIDs\n- Each tile: 10-100KB (lazy loading)\n- Zoomable map interface (like Google Maps) entirely on IPFS\n- Before/after comparison via tile CID diffing\n- Standard GIS tool compatibility (QGIS, ArcGIS)\n\n**Technical Innovation:**\nTraditional approach: Upload 1GB file → One CID → Gateway timeout\nOur approach: Generate tiles → 1,000 CIDs → Progressive loading\n\n**Impact:**\n- Permanent archive of forest change over time\n- Independent verification without proprietary software\n- Distributed caching of popular tiles across IPFS network\n- Change detection algorithm: Compare tile CIDs (2022 vs 2024)\n\n**Case Study 2:: Treekipedia - Permanent AI Research Archive for 67,000+ Tree Species**\n\nWe've built an open-source, AI-powered knowledge repository where every piece of species research is cryptographically verified and permanently stored on IPFS. https://treekipedia.silvi.earth Technical Flow:\nUser sponsors research (3 USDC payment) → Smart contract event triggers backend webhook\nAI research performed (OpenAI/Perplexity) → Comprehensive JSON metadata generated (25+ ecological fields)\nResearch data uploaded to IPFS via Lighthouse → Permanent CID generated\nEAS attestation created on-chain (Base/Celo/Optimism/Arbitrum) with dual IPFS references:\nSchema attestation: Species taxonomy + researcher wallet\nData attestation: Full research metadata CID\nNFT minted (ERC-721) with IPFS metadata URI → Token sent to sponsor's wallet\nDatabase updated with IPFS CID cross-reference for future verification\n\n**Primary End Users:**\n\n1. **Tree Planters (650+ users)**\n   - Individual smallholder farmers and nursery operators\n   - Receive payments for verified reforestation work\n   - Benefit: Economic livelihood tied to biodiversity impact\n   - IPFS Impact: Photos provide permanent proof of work and tamper proof \n\n2. **Campaign Organizers & NGOs**\n   - Conservation organizations distributing reforestation funding\n   - Benefit: Transparent, verifiable impact tracking without site visits\n   - Cost savings with verification trips eliminated due to proof of location, proximity authentication etc\n   - IPFS Impact: Independent audit trail reduces fraud, increases donor confidence. \n\n3. **Donors & Impact Funder**\n   - Individuals and corporations funding biodiversity restoration\n   - Benefit: Cryptographic proof of environmental impact\n   - IPFS Impact: Can verify claims independently without trusting Silvi infrastructure\n\n4. **Researchers & GIS Analysts**\n   - Scientists studying reforestation patterns and ecological change\n   - Easy to retrived/export IPFS research logs\n\n5. **Filecoin/IPFS Ecosystem**\n   - Demonstrates production-scale IPFS usage for climate tech\n   - Proves geospatial data storage viability",
