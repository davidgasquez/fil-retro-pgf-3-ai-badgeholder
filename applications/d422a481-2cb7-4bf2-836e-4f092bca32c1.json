  "description": "The Filecoin Ledger app developed and maintained by Zondax allows users to securely manage and store their Filecoin (FIL) assets using Ledger hardware wallets (like Ledger Nano S, X, Flex or Stax). Ledger hardware wallets provide a more secure way to manage cryptocurrency keys by keeping them offline and away from potential malware or phishing attacks.\nThe Filecoin Ledger App & Installation Hub developed and maintained by Zondax enables users to securely manage and store their Filecoin (FIL) assets using Ledger hardware wallets such as Nano S, Nano S Plus, Nano X, Flex, and Stax. By keeping private keys offline, the app ensures a high level of protection against malware and phishing attacks.\nDistributed through Ledger Live, the app receives frequent updates to enhance performance, compatibility, and security. To simplify testing and installation, Zondax created a dedicated Installation Hub that provides easy access to current and legacy versions of the app.\nSince last year, we’ve released seven major upgrades, all available via the Hub and Ledger Live, and most recently added full support for the new Ledger Gen 5 device.",
  "additional_impact": "By enabling secure management of millions of FIL through hardware wallets, the app builds trust, reduces custody risks, and empowers individuals and organizations to safely participate in the Filecoin economy.",
  "end_user": "The Filecoin Ledger App serves FIL holders, storage providers, developers, and ecosystem contributors who need a secure and user-friendly way to manage Filecoin assets offline using Ledger hardware wallets.",
  "testimonials": "The app has received consistent positive feedback from the Filecoin community and developers for its reliability, ease of installation, and smooth integration through Ledger Live. It’s recognized as the trusted standard for secure FIL storage.",
