  "end_user": "Our project has significantly contributed to expanding awareness and education around decentralized storage and the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) across universities in Uganda.\nWe hosted multiple university meetups introducing students to decentralized storage on Filecoin and how to build with FVM, attracting over 102 students and reaching nearly 1,000 impressions on X (Twitter).\nThrough our FVM Campus Tour across three universities, over 200 students explored how to build decentralized applications (DApps) and deploy smart contracts on FVM. The tour culminated in an FVM Hack Day, where students applied their knowledge in practical projects. Two standout projects emerged PhoLife https://github.com/sam-thetutor/PhoLife\n and Raoster raoster-hosted-1w1kf7kmr-olisehgenesis-projects.vercel.app\nAdditionally, we organized an IPFS workshop with hands-on demos on deploying sites and storing data on Filecoin, engaging 42+ participants.\n\nRecognizing the growing interest in AI, we also hosted an AI and Decentralized Storage meetup, followed by an AI Agents Workshop, bringing together 45+ developers to learn how to build AI agents powered by Filecoin.\nThe end users that have benefited are Students, developers, and local tech communities thata  gained hands on experience with decentralized technologies and opportunities to innovate using Filecoin and FVM.",
