  "filecoin_growth_impact": "•\tReduced gas spend: fee caps + batching typically 20–40% savings on sealing/PoSt costs.\n•\tFewer failed deals: automated escrow top-ups keep market balances above thresholds → near-zero deal failures from insufficient collateral.\n•\tHigher throughput: snap-deals + batch sealing increase onboarding efficiency (multi-× depending on hardware).\n•\tLower ops overhead: unified UI/alerting cuts manual intervention and error rates.\nTogether, these effects increase net FIL-denominated deal volume and improve capacity utilization across the portion of the network run on Curio.",

  "description": "Curio Storage is the open-source control plane for Filecoin Storage Providers. From Nov-2024 to Sep-2025, we’re shipping GA batch sealing (SupraSeal), automated collateral top-ups, dynamic WindowPoSt fee controls with batching, snap-deal orchestration, RBAC/multi-tenant Web UI, and safe deletion/GC. Operators get one pane of glass for clusters, sectors, and pipelines, plus alerting, structured logging, and IPNI retrieval support. Net impact: lower gas and hardware costs, faster onboarding, fewer failed deals, and higher network reliability-already reflected by Curio running a measurable share of the network.",
  "additional_impact": "Safety rails (reviewable GC, wallet exporter), hardened ops best practices (NUMA, hardware sizing, devnet), and horizontal-scale orchestration (Harmony + YugabyteDB) lower barriers for new SPs and help existing providers scale, strengthening decentralization and network resilience.",
  "end_user": "Primary: Filecoin Storage Providers and their SRE/ops teams (solo → enterprise).\nSecondary: Data clients and the broader Filecoin network via lower costs, higher reliability, and faster time-to-store.",
  "testimonials": "Curio is operator infrastructure (not a developer SDK). We measure impact via adoption and ops outcomes rather than developer testimonials. References from active operators can be shared privately upon request. (If the form forces a number: “N/A – infra product.”)",
