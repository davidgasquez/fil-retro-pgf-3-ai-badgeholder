  "description": "The Filecoin Slack Community Admin Program ensures that Filecoin’s global communication channels remain safe, active, and transparent. Between November 2024 and September 2025, the admin team maintained the Filecoin Slack ecosystem - onboarding contributors, enforcing 2FA, conducting quarterly audits, and coordinating moderation across multiple workspaces. This program creates the foundation for open collaboration and trusted governance across the Filecoin community.",
  "additional_impact": "Beyond moderation, this initiative establishes a replicable model for community operations in decentralized ecosystems. It has standardized admin policies, improved audit readiness, and reduced security risks across the network.",
  "end_user": "Every Filecoin community member benefits - from core developers and researchers to ecosystem partners and new contributors. The Slack Admin Program supports all active users across global workspaces, ensuring that all communication channels remain inclusive, secure, and well-managed. Developers can collaborate without spam, phishing, or governance uncertainty.",
  "testimonials": "The project has received consistent positive feedback from ecosystem contributors, moderators, and working group leads who rely on the Filecoin Slack for daily coordination.",
