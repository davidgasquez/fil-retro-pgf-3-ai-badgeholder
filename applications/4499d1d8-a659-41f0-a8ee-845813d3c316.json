  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Blockscout is mission-critical infrastructure that enables Filecoin EVM economic activity:\n\nContract Deployment Infrastructure: 170K+ smart contracts are deployed to Filecoin EVM , and have access to Blockscout verification tooling. Some of these contracts are automatically verified thanks to the Blockscout Bytecode database.  \n\nDeFi Enablement: Our recently launched DEX tracker (https://filecoin.blockscout.com/pools) provides real-time liquidity pool data to track millions of dollars in liquidity. This visibility can help DeFi users make informed trading decisions.\n\nDeveloper Onboarding: Consistent API endpoints and familiar UX (matching Ethereum tooling) reduce friction for developers migrating to Filecoin. Our API serves applications connecting to Filecoin blockchain data.\n\nNetwork Health Monitoring: Real-time block explorer data helps identify network issues, track upgrade adoption, and provide transparency for the entire ecosystem. \n\nTransaction Volume: We provide transparency for 100% of FEVM transactions.",

  "description": "Blockscout is the primary block explorer for Filecoin EVM, serving as essential infrastructure for every developer deploying contracts and every user checking transactions. We've indexed 265M transactions across 2.7M blocks, verified contracts for 170K deployments, and delivered 100% uptime for mainnet and testnet explorers. We've worked closely with the Filecoin team to support all network upgrades, added native address search capabilities, and launched new features like DEX pool tracking and address widgets. As Filecoin EVM adoption grows, Blockscout provides the critical data access layer that enables developers to build with confidence.",
  "additional_impact": "We've built custom functionality to handle Filecoin's unique address formats (f0, f1, f2, f3, f4 addresses) and will continue supporting Filecoin-specifc custom features. As an explorer for many EVM networks, Blockscout provides consistent tooling, API endpoints, and exploration experience which helps to tie networks together and encourage cross-chain collaboration and support.",
  "end_user": "The explorer benefits three key user groups:\n\nDevelopers (primary users): 170K+ contracts deployed on Filecoin EVM. Developers use Blockscout for verification, debugging, logs access and deployment confirmation. Our REST and JSON RPC APIs allow dApps to connect their applications to real-time blockchain data.\n\nEnd Users: Transaction transparency is critical for users who need to verify transfers, check gas fees, and confirm contract interactions. Our transaction interpreter translates complex EVM calls into human-readable actions, making Filecoin accessible to non-technical users.\n\nResearchers & Auditors:  Comprehensive blockchain data access enables security researchers to analyze contract patterns, track token flows, and identify potential vulnerabilities. Our DEX tracker and token analytics provide insights into Filecoin's DeFi ecosystem growth.",
  "testimonials": "As a base-layer protocol we work closely with the development team through dedicated private channels. We solicit feedback in our Discord channels for all chains we support, and have received a lot of positive and constructive feedback from users of all different EVM networks there. \n\nFilPonto says (from Slack): “Blockscout’s Filecoin explorer offers an informed way of looking at Filecoin EVM contracts and their interactions that really helps builders see more of what’s going on. Their EVM bytecode database across many chains has also been a great help in easing contract verification which often has lots of gotchas.\"\n\nIn addition, here are a few testimonials we've received from ecosystem-aligned projects that also support the Filecoin EVM:\n\n“We love the Blockscout team and their open-source ethos! We share their vision for data availability and information transparency. Blockscout gives blockchain users access to the data and views they need to succeed. This is why we've integrated with them so that users can benefit from both platforms.” - Bogdan Habic, Tenderly\n\n“We are very grateful for open-source tooling like Blockscout which allows developers to easily share on-chain statistics with their communities so they can focus on building other things.” - Freddy Zwanzger,\nBlockdaemon",

For example, recently verified contracts include:\n\n- InterchainTokenService: Axelar Network interoperability\n- SafeProxy: Safe multisig\n- Uniswapv3Pool: Various Dexes\n- Drips: Drips streaming protocol used for this application\n- MerkleVester: Vesting Contract\n\nApplications like Drips link to the explorer to view completed transactions. Blockscout also supports standard tooling and libraries such as hardhat and Open Zeppelin within the filecoin context.",
  "filecoin_users_percentage_using_project": "Individuals checking their FEVM transactions or contracts will use Blockscout, so a high percentage of Solidity developers use Blockscout regularly. Projects who need to verify contracts or view transaction information also use the explorer.",
