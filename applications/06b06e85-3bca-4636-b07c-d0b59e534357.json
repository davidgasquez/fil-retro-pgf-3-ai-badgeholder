  "filecoin_growth_impact": "The PLDG Dashboard contributes to the growth and transparency of the Filecoin economy by tracking and visualizing developer engagement, contributions, and progress across five Protocol Labs Developer Guild (PLDG) cohorts.\n\nBy integrating on-chain and off-chain data sources — now openly accessible via the PLDG Cohort Data Archive (please visit  https://tinyurl.com/PLDG-Cohort-Data-Archive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l4wR_zxqHVdhK2A9G-iKCdxG71vQgGtl?usp=drive_link ) - the dashboard enables:\n\n- Mentors and stewards to identify top contributors for FIL-denominated rewards, grants, and RetroPGF programs.\n\n- Developers to measure their OSS impact, reflect on weekly progress, and align better with Filecoin ecosystem goals (e.g., Storacha, libp2p, and FEVM).\n\n- Ecosystem teams to maintain verifiable contribution records stored on Filecoin via Storacha, ensuring transparent data provenance and usage of FIL-backed storage transactions.\n\nTo date, PLDG programs have distributed over $390,000 USD in Filecoin tokens, with the PLDG Dashboard providing continuous visibility into progress, participation, and outcomes across cohorts for contributors to enable better collaboration and improved engagement.\n\n💡 By transforming open-source engagement into measurable impact, the PLDG Dashboard strengthens education, sustainability, and coordination within the Filecoin open economy.",

  "description": "From November 2024 to September 2025, the PLDG Dashboard empowered over 100+ developers in the Protocol Labs Developer Guild (https://www.pldg.xyz/) to learn, collaborate, and measure their open-source impact across the Filecoin and Libp2p ecosystems. By combining real-time analytics, AI-driven summaries, and on-chain data storage via Storacha, it enhanced transparency and engagement within cohort programs. The dashboard supported educational mentorship, open-source coordination, and protocol research—including contributions to Libp2p specification development and ecosystem tooling. Through this initiative, emerging builders gained visibility, recognition, and growth pathways, strengthening the foundations of a more open, data-driven decentralized internet.",
  "additional_impact": "Beyond its current use in cohort analytics and community transparency, the PLDG Dashboard is evolving into a cross-ecosystem insights tool for the broader Filecoin and Protocol Labs developer network.\n\nWe are expanding its functionality to help active contributors across core repositories use the dashboard as a developer impact and engagement metric — offering valuable KPIs that go beyond PR contributions, capturing mentorship, issue resolution, and protocol research participation.\n\nIn the next phase, we aim to explore collaborations with the Near Foundation, Ethereum Foundation, and other open-source innovation ecosystems to align impact measurement across decentralized R&D communities.\nWe are also engaging with contributors to enable them to receive complementary funding from grant programs such as:\n\nOptimism RetroPGF – JS-libp2p Project outreach and contributor participation (https://atlas.optimism.io/project/0x5a7e7c7acb21521e99021d746740b368801cbfe531301e50bdbaafdc24a0aac5)\n\nDeep Funding – deepfunding.ai (for open-source outreach and exploring collaborative funding opportunities, project feedback; please visit https://x.com/OP_medicine_DAO/status/1979215447175119184 )\n\nFilecoin Open Grants and RFPs – Filecoin DevGrants  (https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants?tab=readme-ov-file#requests-for-proposals-rfps )\n\nGitcoin Grants – Ecosystem-aligned OSS funding\n\nPolygon Grants – polygon.technology/grow\n\n\n💡 The PLDG Dashboard thus extends beyond analytics — it aims to become an ecosystem coordination layer for open-source developers, bridging collaboration, funding, and recognition across multiple Web3 research and protocol communities.",
  "end_user": "The primary beneficiaries of the PLDG Dashboard are:\n\nDevelopers and contributors in the Protocol Labs Developer Guild (PLDG) who use the dashboard as a self-reflection and insights tool — helping them understand their learning patterns, improve productivity, and collaborate more effectively across open-source projects.\n\nMentors and ecosystem leads within Filecoin, Libp2p, and IPFS programs who rely on its analytics to track engagement, provide feedback, and assess cohort-wide progress in real time.\n\nProtocol researchers and maintainers working on technologies such as Libp2p specifications and Storacha who use aggregated insights to align development efforts and validate ecosystem health.\n\nCollaborative project teams (e.g., working with Py-libp2p or Storacha MCP) that benefit from transparent contribution data, enabling cross-protocol learning and faster coordination.\n\nBy offering real-time analytics, AI summaries, and persistent on-chain storage, the PLDG Dashboard empowers individuals and teams alike to reflect, adapt, and grow, making developer participation more intentional, data-informed, and community-aligned.",
  "testimonials": "The PLDG Dashboard has received 10+ public positive testimonials and recommendations from developers, mentors, and ecosystem partners within the Filecoin and Protocol Labs network between December 2024 and October 2025.\n \nPlease find the link at https://tinyurl.com/pldg-dashboard-testimonials (Long link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsqh5vc03zKW0Nns42lZROIWab83ARAHTyz8-gBNo3I/edit?usp=sharing )",
