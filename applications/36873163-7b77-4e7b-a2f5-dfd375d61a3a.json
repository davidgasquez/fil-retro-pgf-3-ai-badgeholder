  "description": "Retrievability has always been Filecoin's Achilles' heel. Filecoin Spark has been the first project to make significant inroads into raising awareness and fixing this retrievability problem.\n\nFilecoin Spark is a measurement and incentive protocol that tracks and improves the retrievability of data stored on the Filecoin network. By running automated retrieval tests against hot copies of sealed PoRep deals and aggregating results into a network wide Retrieval Success Rate (RSR), Spark provides transparent verifiable data on retrieval performance across the network and on individual Filecoin Storage Providers. This data powers dashboards and allocation decisions to incentivize high-quality storage with retrievability. Between November 2024 and April 2025, Spark helped the Filecoin Network’s RSR **double** from **13% to 26%**, significantly improving real-world data accessibility on Filecoin.",
  "additional_impact": "-   **Standardized measurement framework:** Spark became the de facto standard for retrieval performance measurement in Filecoin.\n    \n-   **Incentive alignment:** Spark transformed retrieval testing into a feedback loop that motivates SPs to maintain uptime and optimize access paths.\n    \n-   **Data-driven governance:** Allocators now use empirical Spark data when making datacap allocation decisions, improving fairness and accountability.\n    \n-   **Transparency & trust:** The Spark Dashboard provides a public, immutable record of retrieval outcomes, reinforcing trust in Filecoin’s storage utility claims.\n\n**In summary**, Filecoin Spark has made the invisible visible: it quantifies the quality of retrieval across Filecoin, turning measurement into motivation. Through transparent data, public dashboards, and integration with key ecosystem tools, Spark has accelerated the network’s transition from theoretical storage to **verifiable, usable data retrieval**, a cornerstone for Filecoin’s long-term success.",
  "end_user": "-   **Storage Providers (SPs)** benefit directly by gaining visibility into their retrieval performance and improving their reputation and eligibility for datacap allocations. Spark helps SPs diagnose performance bugs and bottlenecks, monitor retrieval outcomes, and demonstrate reliability to clients and allocators.\n    \n-   **Data onboarding programs and allocators** (e.g. datacap allocators & meta-allocators) use Spark metrics to guide datacap distribution based on verifiable performance data rather than subjective assessments.\n    \n-   **Developers and researchers** benefit from open data on retrieval performance, accessible through the Spark API, which supports secondary analysis, dashboards, and retrieval-market tooling.\n    \n-   **The Filecoin network as a whole** benefits as retrieval performance becomes measurable, incentivized, and steadily improving: a crucial step in making Filecoin a truly usable storage and access layer for the decentralized web.",
  "testimonials": "Spark has been adopted and cited across the ecosystem by multiple Filecoin infrastructure and governance teams. Highlights include:\n\n-   Integration into **Starboard**, which uses Spark metrics as part of its network statistics.\n    \n-   Inclusion in the **Filecoin By Numbers** dashboard, where Spark’s RSR data provides visibility into network-level retrieval quality.\n    \n-   Used by **data allocators and meta-allocators** in Fil+ governance discussions as a trusted retrieval measurement source.\n    \n-   Engagement from Storage Providers who have used Spark metrics to improve performance and highlight their retrieval reliability in allocation applications.\n\nIn the previous round of RetroPGF, Spark was the third most rewards project. This is as good a testimonial as any as to the importance the community places on fixing the retrievability problems of Filecoin, and Spark's role in this.",

  "usability_or_infrastructure_impact": "Spark introduces **transparent, automated, verifiable measurements of retrieval performance** - something that was previously anecdotal or unquantified.\n\nKey improvements:\n\n-   **Public Spark Dashboard** ([dashboard.filspark.com](https://dashboard.filspark.com)) provides up-to-date retrieval success rates for every Storage Provider.\n    \n-   **Spark API** ([docs on GitHub](https://github.com/CheckerNetwork/spark-checker)) exposes standardized retrieval metrics for integration into other Filecoin tools.\n    \n-   **On-chain publication** of Spark data enables future smart contracts or DAOs to automate incentive distribution based on real performance, not just storage capacity.\n    \nThis data-driven visibility in retrievability has reduced friction for allocators and boosted confidence in the Filecoin retrieval market’s integrity.",
  "efficiency_increase_impact": "While Spark does not directly modify sealing processes, it significantly increases **retrieval efficiency and reliability** for the hot copies of PoRep sealed data by creating a measurable incentive for Storage Providers to optimize their retrieval infrastructure. Before Spark, the Filecoin Network's retrieval Success Rate was less than 1%. At Spark's peak in April 2025 (i.e. before the IPNI issues of 2025), this figure was up to 26%.",
  "performance_impact": "Spark’s measurable impact on the network is substantial. The **Retrieval Success Rate (RSR)** across the Filecoin network improved from **13% to 26%** between November 2024 and April 2025, a **2× increase** in retrievability, before we faced IPNI outages that affected the Spark scores. These network wide metrics, alongside the more granular retrieval success rate metrics of individual SPs, have provided critical feedback loops for the Filecoin community, making performance visible, actionable, and competitive. \n\nAlthough, since April 2025, network RSR has fluctuated due to external issues with IPNI (Interplanetary Network Indexer), Spark continues to serve as the benchmark and data backbone for understanding and improving Filecoin’s real-world performance.\n\nPlease visit https://dashboard.filspark.com to see more stats.",
