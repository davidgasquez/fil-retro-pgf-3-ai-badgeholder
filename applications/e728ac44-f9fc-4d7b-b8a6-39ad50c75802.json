  "description": "SealGuard is an immutable audit trail system built on Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) that ensures transparent and tamper-proof document verification. From November 2024 to September 2025, SealGuard will empower businesses, organizations, and individuals to store, timestamp, and verify digital records using decentralized storage. The project strengthens trust in data integrity, enhances regulatory compliance, and supports transparency across sectors like legal, finance, and education. By leveraging Filecoin’s verifiable storage and computation, SealGuard bridges the gap between traditional auditing systems and Web3 immutability.",
  "additional_impact": "Educational impact: hosted community demos and workshops introducing developers to Filecoin-based verification.\n\nEcosystem visibility: contributed to discussions around Filecoin as a trust infrastructure layer.\n\nOpen-source collaboration: fostering cross-project synergy with Filecoin Green, Akindo, and others.",
  "end_user": "SealGuard contributes to the Filecoin ecosystem by providing a trustless document authentication layer powered by FVM smart contracts and IPFS/Filecoin storage. It simplifies digital notarization, enabling users to register documents, verify authenticity, and track access history with full transparency.\nOur work has impacted the ecosystem through:\n\nOn-chain document proofing: ensuring long-term verifiable storage.\n\nOpen-source SDK integration: allowing developers to embed SealGuard verification in their apps.\n\nCommunity education: workshops and showcases to promote Filecoin adoption among Web2 developers.\n\nCompliance & enterprise-ready auditing: supporting organizations transitioning to decentralized verification systems.\n\nSealGuard demonstrates how decentralized data ownership and permanence can enhance digital accountability, helping Filecoin become the backbone of trust in record management.\n\nSealGuard primarily benefits:\n\nEnterprises & organizations that require immutable audit trails (banks, insurance firms, legal entities).\n\nDevelopers integrating decentralized verification into apps.\n\nRegulators & auditors needing transparent access to document proofs.\n\nIndividuals securing intellectual property, certificates, and agreements with tamper-proof verification.",
  "testimonials": "SealGuard has received 5+ positive developer testimonials across community calls and GitHub discussions, highlighting its usability, clear APIs, and role in showcasing Filecoin’s potential for verifiable document storage. We were also among the top 15 projects on Filecoin Buildathon on Akindo",
