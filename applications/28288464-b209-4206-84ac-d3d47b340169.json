  "filecoin_growth_impact": "One of the main drivers of the Filecoin economy—see Starboard's Gross Economic Product dashboard (https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/gep)—is the FVM application layer. Due to the steep cost for miners participating in the Filecoin economy, provision of liquidity to miners is a leading application of the FVM. Although business models vary, a common denominator is the need to obtain live information about miners, so as to precisely calculate pricing, interest rate, risk modelling, among other metrics. FVM DeFi protocols including Parasail (who account for 20% of Filecoin's liquidity provisioning marketshare on FVM, see https://fvm.starboard.ventures/explorer/leaderboard) rely on Spacescope to facilitate these intricate pricing calculations.",

  "description": "Spacescope is an API service for the Filecoin ecosystem, enabling teams across the Filecoin ecosystem direct access to important Filecoin metrics for free. The scope of the metrics include data aggregated at different levels, e.g. network power, gas usage and circulating supply by day, or information about reward mining and sector sealing at the storage provider level. Last year, Spacescope served 35 million API calls to users across the ecosystem. \n\n**Recent Impact**\n* Over the reporting period, Spacescope served 35 million API calls to users across the ecosystem\n* Spacescope has expanded coverage of its data to cover the Filecoin Virtual Machine\n* Work undergoing to provide full historical data, a long-requested feature.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "A wide range of users benefit from Spacescope, from casual users to advanced developers. Spacescope is a primary data source for various ecosystem teams (Filecoin TLDR, Filecoin Data Portal), blockchain analytics (Messari's periodic reports on Filecoin directly query from Spacescope). Spacescope also powers Starboard's Network Health Dashboard (https://dashboard.starboard.ventures). \n\nWe have also seen strong uptake in users who are using Spacescope as part of a composable analytics platform. Our most popular API endpoints are related to storage provider information. We are aware of entities such as storage providers and accounting firms using Spacescope as a primary data source to track miner information, profit and loss, and gas usage, as well as ecosystem teams such as Parasail, who use Spacescope data for adjusting their liquidity provision algorithms.",
  "testimonials": "No direct links to testimonials, but we regularly field questions about accessing endpoints, making certain new data available, etc, which suggests strong uptake within the community.",
