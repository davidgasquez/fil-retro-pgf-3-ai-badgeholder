  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Our project contributes directly to the Filecoin economy by providing critical infrastructure for cross-chain liquidity and interoperability between the Ethereum and Filecoin ecosystems.\n\nIt enables developers to build applications where FIL-denominated assets can be seamlessly and atomically swapped with Ethereum-based assets. This makes the Filecoin economy more accessible and integrated with the broader DeFi landscape.\n\nAs an open-source tool integrated by third-party applications (like pldg-dashboard), we do not track the specific FIL-denominated transaction volume that flows through their platforms. Our contribution is enabling this new transactional capability to exist in the first place.",

  "description": "ETH-FIL-SWAP is an open-source project designed to facilitate atomic swaps of assets between the Ethereum (ETH) and Filecoin (FIL) networks.\n\nIt functions as a foundational component or SDK that allows developers to integrate cross-chain swap functionality into their applications. The swap mechanism is built to be atomic and secure, utilizing a trusted escrow contract. This enables users of integrated platforms (like PLDG Dashboard or EMTTR) to exchange ERC20 tokens for FIL, and vice-versa, without relying on a centralized exchange.",
  "additional_impact": "The project's main impact is serving as a key enabler for developers. By providing a secure, decentralized, and atomic swap mechanism, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for building sophisticated cross-chain applications on the FVM.\n\nThis encourages more developer experimentation and innovation that connects the Filecoin network to the liquidity and user base of the Ethereum ecosystem.",
  "end_user": "The primary users of this project are developers and other projects within the Ethereum and Filecoin ecosystems.\n\nIt is an open-source SDK/component that provides foundational cross-chain swap functionality. The ultimate beneficiaries are the end users of the applications that integrate this tool, such as the PLDG Dashboard and EMTTR. These users benefit from the seamless interoperability and ability to swap assets between Ethereum and Filecoin without directly interacting with our underlying code.",
  "testimonials": "As an underlying open-source software (OSS) component rather than a direct-to-consumer product, we don't collect direct reviews.\n\nInstead, our primary \"testimonial\" is developer adoption and integration. The project's value is demonstrated by other developer teams building on top of it.",
