  "filecoin_growth_impact": "UCAN contributes to the Filecoin ecosystem by providing a shared, user-controlled authorization layer that makes decentralized storage and identity practical for real-world applications. It allows developers to build apps where trust and access flow cryptographically between users and services—without central servers or intermediaries.\n\nWhile UCAN itself does not directly process FIL-denominated transactions, it serves as essential infrastructure for projects that do. Many Filecoin and IPFS-based tools already depend on UCAN to handle identity, delegation, and verifiable access, helping expand the developer base and real-world adoption of decentralized technologies.\n\nImportantly, UCAN also **acts as a bridge** to the conventional web, letting developers integrate decentralized storage and authorization into familiar web stacks. This lowers the barrier to entry for traditional developers and organizations, bringing new participants into the Filecoin economy and enabling hybrid applications that can operate seamlessly between the centralized and decentralized worlds.\n\nIn short, UCAN broadens Filecoin’s reach by making decentralized trust models usable, interoperable, and accessible to the broader web ecosystem.",

  "description": "UCAN is a trustless, secure, local-first, user-originated authorization and revocation scheme. UCAN is designed to be very flexible: you can use it offline, online, fully P2P, federated, or with central servers.\n\nUCAN is a secure, decentralised RPC protocol used by many projects in the ecosystem (e.g. Storacha) to handle auth and act as a generic API. It allows end-users to granularly permission services and other users access to their data. In 2025 we have shipped implementation of the stable v1.0 spec in JS and Golang, with Rust nearing completion.",

  "end_user": "The ultimate beneficiaries of UCAN are everyday people who use digital tools to create, collaborate, and share their work. UCAN is designed to give individuals direct control over who can access their data and how that access is granted—without needing to trust a central company or platform.\n\nIn practice, this means:\n\n1. Creators and collaborators can share documents, messages, or files directly with others, with fine-grained, revocable permissions that they control.\n2. Teams and communities can work together across devices and applications without surrendering ownership of their data to a single vendor.\n3. Users of local-first and peer-to-peer apps benefit from seamless, secure experiences that work offline and preserve their privacy by design.\n\nUCAN also helps developers—by making it easier (and often possible) to connect different tools and services under a common, user-centric authorization model. Instead of every app managing its own identity and access system, UCAN allows permissions and trust to flow naturally between apps chosen by the user.\n\nThe result is an ecosystem where people truly own their data, and developers can build interoperable experiences that respect that ownership.",
