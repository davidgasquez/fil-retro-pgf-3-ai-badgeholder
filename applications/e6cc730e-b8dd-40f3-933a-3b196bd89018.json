  "description": "CIDgravity is an onboarding platform designed to make storing data on the Filecoin network as simple and seamless as uploading to an S3 bucket. By building an S3 connector to Filecoin, CIDgravity lowers the technical barrier to entry, enabling developers, enterprises, and applications to onboard data without needing deep protocol knowledge.\nThis infrastructure bridges familiar Web2 storage workflows with decentralized storage, accelerating ecosystem growth and adoption. By providing a reliable and user-friendly entry point, CIDgravity helps make Filecoin more accessible, interoperable, and efficient — empowering more builders and users to join the network.",

  "end_user": "### Case Study 1: NFT.Storage  \n**Challenge:** NFT.Storage required a solution to guarantee perpetual storage and verifiable data retrieval across a large, decentralized dataset.  \n**Solution:** Migrated to **CIDgravity**, leveraging its Filecoin Gateway for automated healing, retrieval checks, and continuous data validation.  \n**Impact:** CIDgravity now powers NFT.Storage’s perpetual storage layer, ensuring NFTs remain permanently accessible, self-healing, and verifiably stored on Filecoin — strengthening trust and reliability for millions of users.\n\n---\n\n### Case Study 2: Solana (Triton)  \n**Challenge:** Solana’s chain explorer, **Triton**, needed high-performance, decentralized storage to serve real-time blockchain data while maintaining redundancy.  \n**Solution:** Implemented **CIDgravity’s Hot Storage layer** on top of Filecoin, enabling hybrid storage optimized for speed and decentralization.  \n**Impact:** Triton can now serve chain data efficiently from decentralized sources, combining Web3 transparency with Web2-level performance and reliability.\n\n---\n\n### Case Study 3: Aurora Infrastructure  \n**Challenge:** Aurora sought to integrate decentralized storage into its onboarding and client management tools without compromising performance or complexity.  \n**Solution:** Integrated **CIDgravity Gateway** directly into their internal codebase and dashboards to handle storage operations seamlessly.  \n**Impact:** Aurora’s clients now benefit from high-performance, decentralized data storage fully backed by Filecoin, enabling scalable, secure, and frictionless onboarding.",
  "testimonials": "We do not actively track the number of formal reviews or testimonials. However, **CIDgravity has built a strong reputation within the Filecoin ecosystem**, recognized for its reliability, performance, and close collaboration with core projects. \n\nOur strong partnerships and ongoing community engagement reflect **consistently positive feedback from developers and ecosystem partners**, even if not formally quantified.",
