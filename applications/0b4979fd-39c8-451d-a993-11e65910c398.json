  "description": "Analyze relevant data such as sector punishment in the Filecoin network to help miners optimize management and study economic trends.\n- Retrieve node sector expiration times, number of expired sectors, pledge release upon expiration, and termination penalties (penalties if sectors are terminated at query time)\n- Get detailed vesting schedule for node locked funds\n- Get current network daily fee\n- Get daily fee information for specific SPs\n- Get fault fee for 32G sectors\n\nDuring this period, help SP understand the cost of exit, the release details of rewards, and the dailyfee introduced by FIP100, so that SP can calculate costs and profits more clearly.",
  "additional_impact": "Help SP, an important role in the filecoin ecosystem, understand the cost composition, plan funds in advance, and let SP make more decisions more transparently and clearly. At the same time, calculate the exit cost for SP withdrawers.",
  "end_user": "There are three main categories of my target users.\nSP, this is also most of the users, because I provide them with very clear data.\ncefi, many institutions are directly or indirectly using my tools to help calculate the maximum amount of loans they can provide and provide risk control.\ndefi, some centralized contracts use my source code to compare the correctness of their logic.",
