  "description": "The NANODC project is a next-generation data center platform that supports AI computing and decentralized storage ecosystems through ultra-compact all-in-one rack–based distributed physical infrastructure. The system features real-time operational transparency and monitoring, allowing users to check installation details and the operational status of all nodes in real time, with an intuitive touchscreen interface that enables even non-experts to manage operations easily. Additionally, by integrating DeFi (Decentralized Finance) technology, NANODC provides asset custody and reward functionalities, allowing users to earn rewards such as Filecoin (FIL) and monitor them transparently through a dedicated dashboard. Furthermore, by linking with liquidity pools like FiLMountain, the system enables high-profit opportunities beyond simple node operation. Combining real-time operational data, transparent reward structures, and active user participation, NANODC is evolving into a token economy–based franchise data center platform that redefines participation in core infrastructures of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.",
  "additional_impact": "First, the NANODC project makes a significant contribution to the expansion of SPs (Storage Providers). Thanks to its intuitive monitoring features and easy node and server management, new SPs can participate without heavy technical burdens. Additionally, the project enables SPs to efficiently cover the pledge required for sealing, promoting storage capacity growth and economic activity within the Filecoin network. Furthermore, with real-time operational data and transparent reward structures, the project provides a trustworthy ecosystem for both SPs and users, contributing to the overall vitality of the Filecoin economy.\n\nSecond, the NANODC project provides profit opportunities for Filecoin holders. With the recent significant drop in Filecoin prices, many holders face challenges. However, through NANODC, they can invest their coins and utilize them to operate and develop nodes within the platform. The rewards generated from these activities are shared with the holders, creating value beyond simple holding and encouraging continued economic participation. Moreover, integrated DeFi features and transparent reward mechanisms allow holders to monitor their investments and rewards in real time, ensuring reliability and security.\n\nFinally, the NANODC project positively impacts the Filecoin ecosystem as a whole. High-quality data is continuously stored on the Filecoin network, providing a stable and reliable storage environment. By consistently onboarding new users and SPs, the total volume of data stored on the network is increasing, directly contributing to the network's utility and ecosystem growth. Additionally, NANODC’s transparent operations and real-time monitoring enhance the reliability of data management, creating a safe environment for both users and developers to leverage the network confidently.",
  "end_user": "1 – Node Operators and Storage Providers\nWith NANODC’s intuitive management interface and real-time monitoring capabilities, node operators and storage providers (SPs) with limited technical expertise can efficiently manage distributed data center nodes and offer decentralized data storages. Operators contribute their computing resources to the platform and earn consistent rewards, while SPs receive fair compensation through smart contract–based reward mechanisms. The platform also provides real-time performance analytics and automated optimization features, enhancing operational efficiency and enabling users to actively contribute to network growth. Through this system, NANODC simultaneously promotes the activation of decentralized infrastructure and builds trust within the ecosystem.\n\n2 – Investors and Filecoin Holders\nBoth institutional and individual investors can leverage NANODC’s transparent DeFi integration to invest in AI computing infrastructure. By providing liquidity to the platform’s token ecosystem, they gain predictable returns while supporting the growth of decentralized storage and computing networks.",
  "testimonials": "This project is not aimed at developers; however, ZetaCube has attended numerous Filecoin events to showcase the NANODC project, and it was praised and welcomed by nearly all attendees.",
  "website": "https://service.nanodc.info",
  "unique_transacting_addresses_per_project": "Users of the NANODC project each possess a unique address and continue to engage in transactions on the platform. Currently, the number of unique addresses performing recurring transactions exceeds 100, and this figure is expected to grow further as both project participation and activity within the Filecoin ecosystem continue to increase.",

  "new_funded_addresses": "N/A",
  "wallet_interactions_increase": "Currently, over 100 users are actively utilizing the NANODC project, and interactions with Filecoin wallets continue to grow steadily. Zetacube is pursuing official certification as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in South Korea to expand this business, and is preparing to launch the FILMountain service. This will enable more users and investors to participate in the NANODC ecosystem, further enhancing the platform’s usability and financial activities.",
  "retained_users_average": "More than 100 users are actively utilizing the NANODC project, and the user base continues to grow. With the official launch of the FILMountain service, the platform’s accessibility and functionality are expected to attract an additional 5,000 to 10,000 users. This is anticipated to significantly expand Filecoin wallet interactions and user participation within the NANODC ecosystem.",
