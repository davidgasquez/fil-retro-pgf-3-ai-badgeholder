  "filecoin_growth_impact": "FIL-B materially contributed to the Filecoin economy by onboarding teams deploying storage-powered applications and integrating cross-chain data infrastructure. While we cannot directly track FIL movement attributable to our programs, they supported developer activity and incentive flows across Filecoin testnet environments through hackathons, builder grants, and Alpha Cohort participation, supporting developer experimentation and deployment. A substantial share of this activity occurs on testnet, given our role in onboarding and maturing new builders, with the funnel designed to ultimately drive mainnet adoption. While direct attribution of mainnet conversion is difficult at the program level, observed progression from testnet deployments to mainnet experimentation, ecosystem integrations, and continued developer participation indicates measurable impact on network health and growth.\n\nBy improving FEVM parity (MCOPY, TSTORAGE, Account Abstraction), maintaining FIL Frame, and delivering contract verification tooling, we reduced friction for builders and supported the 13K Monthly Active Users on FEVM. Cross-chain bridge work with Avalanche expanded access to Filecoin services for a network with approximately 43,000 average daily active users, creating future demand pathways for FIL-denominated activity. Additionally, the Alpha Cohort pioneered use of USDFC, distributing USDFC on mainnet to participating teams and initiating early stablecoin-denominated economic flows on Filecoin.",

  "description": "FIL-B is Filecoin’s independent developer-experience (DX) initiative, driving grassroots adoption through open-source tools, learning resources, and global builder and non-builder community programs. In this period, high impact includes:\n1. Technical initiatives to support dapp devs (e.g. maintaining FEVM parity with EVM, and flagship FIL Frame starter kit, contract verification CLI/npm, cross-chain data bridge launch with Avalanche c-chain)\n2. Builder programs to grow adoption with dapp devs (e.g. leading the AI Blueprint Hackathon with Encode, leading the Filecoin Onchain Cloud Alpha Cohort, running Filecoin's presence at multiple hackathons) \n3. Community initiatives to cultivate quality ambassadors and contributors to Filecoin (e.g. leading Filecoin Orbit, running Code n Corgi builder series)",

  "filecoin_addresses_onboarded": "According to Starboard’s FEVM analytics dashboard for the period November 2024 to September 2025 (https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/chart/fvm-usage/acbbat), EVM account counts increased over the period by ~60%. Data indicates an approximate rise from ~50,000 to ~80,000 EVM accounts over the window, alongside steady growth in placeholder and ethaccount types. This reflects expanding developer and contract activity aligned with the timeframe of FIL‑B onboarding efforts.",
  "active_devs_increase": "FIL-B programs sustained a consistent pipeline of engaged builders and contributors during the period. Engagement can be estimated based on measurable participation: 101 Alpha Cohort submissions on AKINDO (~200 builders), ~3,000 attendees across 16+ Orbit events, 500+ developers completing the 5 Code n Corgi sessions, continued activity in the 385 member Telegram group, and ~1,500 developers actively building for Filecoin through Encode, PL Genesis, and ETHGlobal hackathons. These participation touch points indicate a sustained and recurring builder funnel. Based on these inputs, total direct participants across programs during the period can be estimated at approximately ~5,000 active individuals.\n\nIn addition, technical tooling maintained and delivered by FIL-B, including FEVM parity improvements and the contract verification CLI, directly supported the scalability and usability of the Filecoin EVM stack, contributing to the ~13K Monthly Active Users on FEVM by reducing friction and enabling builders to deploy and verify smart contracts efficiently.\n\nLastly, cross-chain infrastructure work, including the Filecoin to Avalanche C-Chain data bridge initiative, expanded access to Filecoin services for a broader developer base and aligned Filecoin with approximately 43,000 average daily active users on Avalanche C-Chain.",
