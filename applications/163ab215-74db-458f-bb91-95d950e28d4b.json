  "description": "Fips.cc is a platform to interpret Filecoin FIPs and track their impacts. It provides \"role-oriented\" impact analysis for each FIP: SPs can evaluate revenue and cost changes and adjust operational strategies; developers can stay current on interface and compatibility changes; clients can assess effects on service quality; and investors can gain insight into incentive and fee structure adjustments to better anticipate network trends. By providing a professional monitoring and reporting system, Fips.cc delivers continuous tracking and visualization of key FIPs, validating outcomes with real-world data.",
  "additional_impact": "FIPs.cc has created additional impact by addressing two critical information gaps in the Filecoin governance process:\n\nThe FIP repository on GitHub provides comprehensive technical documentation, but this technical focus often leaves key stakeholders—particularly Storage Providers and FIL token holders—unable to clearly understand how proposals will impact their operations. FIPs.cc translates technical specifications into stakeholder-specific insights, democratizing access to governance information and enabling meaningful participation from all community segments.\n\nHistorically, the community has lacked tools to verify or monitor FIP outcomes using real-world network data. This gap made it difficult to assess whether protocol changes achieved their intended goals. FIPs.cc addresses this by providing data-driven monitoring and verification capabilities that bridge the divide between forecasts and reality.\n\nBy filling these gaps between technical and business perspectives, and between forecasts and outcomes, FIPs.cc enhances community engagement and consensus-building around protocol changes, smooths the network upgrade process by increasing transparency and reducing uncertainty, and supports informed decision-making that drives sustainable network growth.",
  "end_user": "Fips.cc serves a diverse user base through its role-oriented approach:\n\n• Storage Providers optimize operations based on cost/revenue analysis\n\n• Developers maintain compatibility through timely technical updates\n\n• Clients make informed decisions about service quality impacts\n\n• Investors anticipate network trends through incentive structure insights\n\nEach user group receives tailored analysis relevant to their specific role in the Filecoin ecosystem.",
  "testimonials": "Launched on September 24, 2025, alongside NV27, FIPs.cc has been recognized for providing essential FIP analysis from multiple stakeholder perspectives, addressing the critical need to track and monitor FIP outcomes after network upgrades, helping community members understand business impacts and adjust accordingly, and enabling implementers to monitor and verify implementation results.\n\nTestimonials:\n\nhttps://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C05P37R9KQD/p1758505517612509\n\nhttps://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C028PCH8L31/p1758592553348249\n\nAs a recently launched project, additional testimonials are expected as community adoption continues to grow.",
