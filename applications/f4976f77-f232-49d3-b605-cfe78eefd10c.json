  "filecoin_growth_impact": "FIL-denominated transactions enabled: Over 1.5 million FIL in total protocol volume since inception.\n\n\nExpanded FIL liquidity usage by allowing SPs to reinvest borrowed FIL into sealing operations and storage growth.\n\n\nLaunched FIG token, a governance and incentive layer that drives user participation, yield distribution, and staking rewards.\n\nSupported cross-chain expansion (BNB Chain) to extend FIL’s economic reach and attract external liquidity back into Filecoin.",

  "description": "From November 2024 to September 2025, FILLiquid advanced decentralized finance on Filecoin by providing a seamless on-chain lending and staking protocol for Storage Providers (SPs) and FIL holders. Our platform unlocked FIL liquidity for SPs to scale storage capacity, while enabling FIL holders to earn sustainable yield through non-custodial staking. FILLiquid contributed to Filecoin’s real-world utility, driving adoption, capital efficiency, and user engagement across multiple regions. Through continuous community education, partnerships, and transparent growth, we strengthened the Filecoin DeFi ecosystem and reinforced FIL’s role as an active economic asset.",
  "additional_impact": "Strengthened trust and transparency: All transactions and yields are fully on-chain, verified via smart contracts.\n\nEcosystem alignment: Actively engaged in Filecoin governance and allocator initiatives to connect DeFi and data storage economies.\n\nCommunity empowerment: FILLiquid established multilingual communities, improving accessibility and global engagement for the Filecoin ecosystem.\n\nSustainability: Built a recurring value loop — SP borrowing drives FIL demand, FIL staking increases protocol liquidity, and protocol revenue supports FIG stakers — reinforcing long-term ecosystem health.",
  "end_user": "FILLiquid primarily serves Filecoin Storage Providers (SPs) and FIL token holders.\nSPs use FILLiquid to borrow FIL and expand their storage operations efficiently.\nFIL holders stake their FIL through the protocol to earn yield, participate in governance, and strengthen Filecoin’s decentralized economy.\nAdditionally, developers and ecosystem partners benefit from the open smart contract infrastructure and transparent on-chain data that FILLiquid contributes.",
  "testimonials": "FILLiquid received positive recognition and support from ecosystem participants, including SPs, builders, and partner projects:\nTestimonials and engagement can be found via FILLiquid Twitter/X and Discord Community.\nPositive Reviews on Github: https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/744#discussioncomment-14482098\n\n\nNotable mentions from Filecoin Plus (Fil+) Allocator Program, where FILLiquid was officially onboarded with an initial 5 PiB DataCap, reflecting trust and recognition within the Filecoin governance community.\nhttps://github.com/filecoin-project/Allocator-Governance/discussions/400\nhttps://github.com/filecoin-project/Allocator-Registry/pull/950\n\nSPs and community developers have publicly endorsed FILLiquid’s impact in improving FIL capital efficiency and liquidity access.",
