  "description": "OSO is building the open-source data backbone for measuring and rewarding impact in web3. From November 2024 to September 2025, our platform powered key decentralized funding programs including Optimism Retro Funding and Ethereum Deep Funding, helping direct more than $10M to high-impact builders and protocols. Developers and analysts use our Python API and web studio to explore activity across hundreds of thousands of open-source repos, audit impact claims, and generate transparent metrics. OSO is setting the standard for open, verifiable attribution in decentralized ecosystems.",
  "additional_impact": "We maintain the OSS Directory — a public registry mapping open-source projects to their code artifacts — which includes hundreds of Filecoin ecosystem repos and curated collections. This shared index enables Filecoin projects to be automatically recognized in cross-ecosystem funding graphs, including Optimism Retro Funding and Ethereum Deep Funding. As a result, Filecoin builders gain greater visibility, improved attribution for their work, and seamless inclusion in open-data ecosystems and funding pipelines.",
  "end_user": "Public goods funders and the builders they support. Grant reviewers, analysts, and ecosystem stewards use OSO to see what’s working — and builders use it to credibly prove their impact.",
  "testimonials": "We don't have any off-the-shelf testimonials, but have worked closely with David Gasquez (filecoindataportal.xyz), various libp2p maintainer teams, as well as the Fil-RetroPGF and CEL teams. We nucleated in 2023 from the Network Funding team.",

In the last two Fil RetroPGF rounds, we provided public datasets, dashboards, and project metadata covering hundreds of participating teams. This included developer activity, traction signals, and dependency lineage -- all available through our open data warehouse and Python API.\n\nBy surfacing transparent metrics and project context, OSO empowered badgeholders to better evaluate contributions, benchmark impact, and participate more confidently in funding decisions. Open data lowered the barrier to informed participation and expanded who can contribute to governance, from independent analysts to seasoned ecosystem experts.",
