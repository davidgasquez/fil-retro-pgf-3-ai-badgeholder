  "description": "ND Allocator is an independent governance channel within the Filecoin Plus (Fil+) program operated by ND Labs. It focuses on onboarding Cyberport and enterprise datasets into Filecoin through structured workflows, KYB verification, and transparent allocation mechanisms. ND Allocator contributes to improving the quality and auditability of verified data, bridging enterprise data sources with the decentralized storage economy.",
  "additional_impact": "Helped prototype community co-review mechanisms, where multiple verifiers can participate in the same review process.\n\n\nServes as a reference governance model for integrating enterprise clients with decentralized infrastructure.\n\n\nDemonstrated how regional SPs and allocators can contribute meaningfully to the global Fil+ program.",
  "end_user": "Enterprise data clients — gain structured onboarding and verification support for uploading datasets to Filecoin.\n\n\nFil+ Allocators and reviewers — benefit from improved review templates, consistent governance practices, and KYB workflows.\n\n\nFilecoin governance community — gains more auditable, transparent, and reproducible allocator operations.",
  "testimonials": "ND Allocator has received 10+ positive reviews from Fil+ governance members, enterprise clients, and ecosystem reviewers.\nGovernance contributors commended ND Allocator’s structured due diligence and audit transparency.\n\n\nEnterprise users praised the clear submission process and data traceability.",
