  "description": "Boxo is a Golang IPFS library that powers the most impactful IPFS-based applications, including Lotus, Venus, Boost, IPNI, Lassie, Kubo and many more. Kubo is the first and most widely used IPFS implementation whether in desktop or server environments. If you are an IPFS user you have likely leveraged these tools.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "Boxo both powers the internals of the Filecoin network, as well as the external-user facing side of the network by being the most widely used IPFS implementation.\n\nAny user of kubo, ipfs.io / dweb.link, IPFS Desktop, IPFS websites loaded via eth.limo, etc. are all using boxo under the hood. Additionally, work on boxo and kubo tends to be the major driver in IPFS compatibility tooling, specifications and overall evolution.",
  "testimonials": "Kubo has ~17k GitHub stars, is the most widely used IPFS implementation today and powers nearly the entire Amino DHT which is used by all IPFS mainnet clients. Most IPFS users today, whether running their own IPFS implementations or leveraging an third-party service rely on boxo in their data pipelines (e.g. via gateways like ipfs.io / dweb.link, eth.limo, etc.).",
