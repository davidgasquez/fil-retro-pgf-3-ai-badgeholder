  "description": "Throughout the RetroPGF Round 3 period, the FIP Editors group maintained the open governance process that enables protocol change in Filecoin.  \nEditors reviewed, formatted, and stewarded proposals including [FIP-0100](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0100.md), [FIP-0105](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0105.md), [FIP-0106](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0106.md), [FIP-0109](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0109.md), and [FIP-0077](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0077.md), ensuring clarity, completeness, and alignment across implementers. \n\nFIP Editors triaged and merged dozens of PRs, improved editorial standards, and coordinated with authors and the Implementers WG during NV25–NV27 upgrades.  \n\nBy keeping the proposal pipeline transparent and consistent, the Editors upheld neutral, community-driven protocol governance.",
  "additional_impact": "The Editors strengthened Filecoin’s open governance model by maintaining a transparent and consistent proposal pipeline.  \n\nThey updated editorial guidelines, clarified status transitions, and improved issue labelling and tracking in the repository.  \n\nThese efforts help new contributors navigate the FIPs process and ensure the long-term sustainability of Filecoin protocol governance.",
  "end_user": "All Filecoin protocol contributors - client teams, researchers, service providers, and builders - benefit from the FIP Editors’ work.  \n\nBy ensuring every FIP is accurate, reviewable, and properly recorded, the Editors provide the foundation for predictable upgrades and transparent decision-making.  \n\nDevelopers gain clear specifications to implement, while the community gains confidence that protocol changes are evaluated through an open and consistent process.",
  "testimonials": "Positive feedback appears regularly in FIP PR threads, Implementers WG calls, and community discussions, highlighting the Editors’ responsiveness and clarity in guiding proposals through review and merge.  \n\nContributors praise the Editors’ neutrality and attention to detail that reduce friction for proposal authors.  \n\nExamples are visible in merged PR comment threads within the [FIPs repository](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs).",
