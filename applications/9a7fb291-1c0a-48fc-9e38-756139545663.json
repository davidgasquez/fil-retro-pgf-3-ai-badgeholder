  "description": "Keypo is an open-source, decentralized solution for sharing private data on Filecoin Onchain Cloud. Built as part of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud Alpha Cohort, Keypo's TypeScript SDK integrates with the Synapse SDK, using smart contracts for access control logic (ACL), Lit Protocol for ACL enforcement, and Filecoin Onchain Cloud for encrypted storage. The architecture takes a typical server-based ACL system and makes it serverless: anyone can use the Keypo SDK with zero vendor lock-in and no ongoing maintenance required.\n\nWe are currently working with the Fil-Oz team to make Keypo the first ACL plugin for the Synapse SDK.",
  "additional_impact": null,
  "end_user": "We built the Keypo SDK based on feedback from the Fil-Oz team that there was a need for an open-source, decentralized access control solution for Filecoin Onchain Cloud. We expect a variety of end users to benefit from this SDK:\n\n1. DApps that use Filecoin Onchain Cloud for user data storage.\n2. Individual users that want a platform agnostic, self-custody solution to storing their data on the web.\n3. Content creators and professionals who need to securely share sensitive files (contracts, medical records, financial documents) with specific parties while maintaining full control over access permissions.",
  "testimonials": "The Keypo SDK went live two weeks ago and we are working closely with a few members of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud Alpha Cohort to integrate the SDK into their DApps.\n\nWe also received positive confirmation from numerous members of the Fil-Oz and Filecoin team that an access control solution like Keypo is needed for the Filecoin Onchain Cloud launch, which is why we are now working closely on releasing an official plugin for the Synapse SDK.",
