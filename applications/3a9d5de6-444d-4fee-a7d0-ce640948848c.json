  "description": "Filecoin Orbit Kenya catalyzed decentralized storage adoption across Kenya through 10 strategic meetups and workshops (physical and virtual) from November 2024 to September 2025. We educated developers, researchers, and entrepreneurs on leveraging Filecoin's infrastructure for real-world applications—from decentralized storage solutions to AI-powered dApps. Through hands-on workshops and collaborative events with partner communities, we built a vibrant ecosystem of over 1070 participants, fostering technical expertise and innovation. Our initiatives bridged the knowledge gap, enabling Kenyan developers to contribute meaningfully to the global Filecoin network while addressing local data sovereignty and storage challenges.",
