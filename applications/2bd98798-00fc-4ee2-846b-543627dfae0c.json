  "description": "Beryx Free API facilitates interaction with historical Filecoin data (FVM and FEVM) and enables users to search for addresses, contracts, transactions (including ERC-20), blocks, heights, and events. The Beryx Filecoin API provides free and open access to comprehensive Filecoin blockchain data including both FVM and FEVM layers. It allows developers to query addresses, contracts, transactions (including ERC-20), blocks, heights, and events with ease.\nThis year, we significantly expanded the API with new endpoints for miners, datacap, deals, and the Verified Registry. These additions make it easier than ever to build integrations, analytics tools, and dashboards powered by Filecoin data.\nExplore the documentation here: Beryx Docs (https://docs.zondax.ch/openapi#get-/account/balance/-address-)",
