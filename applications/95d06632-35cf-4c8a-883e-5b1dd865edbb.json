  "description": "OneForm automates the Fil+ allocator intake process through verified social accounts and structured KYB forms, reducing reviewer workload while improving transparency and auditability. Since Nov 2024, it has launched end-to-end workflows, reviewer dashboards, and analytics that enable more SPs to apply transparently under KYB-first governance rules.",
  "additional_impact": "Beyond governance automation, OneForm contributes to the sustainability and auditability of the Fil+ program:\n\t•\tEstablishes an interoperable form and social verification framework that can be reused by other governance tools.\n\t•\tProvides an early foundation for community co-review systems, where allocators, SPs, and volunteers can stake and co-sign transparently.\n\t•\tPromotes “social trust” as a governance primitive within Filecoin.",
  "end_user": "The primary beneficiaries are Filecoin Plus Allocators, reviewers, and Storage Providers (SPs) applying for DataCap.\n\t•\tFor Allocators and reviewers, OneForm reduces manual workload through automated KYB verification, structured submissions, and a unified dashboard for intake management.\n\t•\tFor SPs, it simplifies and standardizes the application process, enabling transparent submission and status tracking.\n\t•\tFor the broader governance community, it increases participation by making allocator workflows auditable and easier to understand.",
  "testimonials": "OneForm has received many positive testimonials from active Allocators, reviewers, and SP teams in the Fil+ ecosystem.\nhttps://github.com/WorldPeace1121/one-form-social-cap",
