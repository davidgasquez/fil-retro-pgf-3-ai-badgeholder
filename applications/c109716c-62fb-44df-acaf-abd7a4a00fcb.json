  "filecoin_growth_impact": "B<>rder/ess has contributed to growing the Filecoin economy by integrating Filecoin technology into developer education, tooling, and real-world applications.\n\nThrough our hubs, Cipher Sessions, and open-source SDKs like ByteStore, we’ve trained over 30 developers to build dApps that use Filecoin for decentralized storage and data handling.\n\nOur community-built tools and prototypes currently support an estimated 300–500 FIL-denominated transactions across testnets and small-scale deployments, powering savings protocols, storage experiments, and student-led Filecoin-based applications.\n\nBeyond transaction volume, B<>rder/ess has expanded Filecoin’s developer base, ensuring that decentralized storage becomes a standard integration in next-generation Web3 projects emerging from African universities and beyond.",

  "description": "From November 2024 to September 2025, B<>rder/ess empowered hundreds of university developers to build with Filecoin and Ethereum, integrating decentralized storage into real-world dApps. We have also built an SDK that helps make integrating projects in Filecoin easier for web2 users.\n\nThrough our Web3 hubs, Cipher Sessions, and open-source tools like the ByteStore SDK, we made Filecoin more accessible for student developers and creators. Our programs expanded to 14+ universities, hosted 3 major Web3 events, and launched new builder toolkits, enabling students to move from learning to deploying scalable, decentralized applications.\n\n\n# REPORT\n**November 2024 - B<>rder/ess 3.0** - https://www.youtube.com/live/_MJLpylRZQc?si=ecLWq6MzZIQKn9gH\n\n1. Filecoin featured at B<>rder/ess 3.0 to over 1,000 attendees in 7 different Universities, where Sir Enoch https://x.com/Divine_Vessel from Filecoin Nigeria Lead spoke about Filecoin Decentralized Storage https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1852334449926476215 \n\n2. Transitioned 20+ developers during the event across 7 universities to build on Filecoin\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZcMkpUqhXcsONyQqRh_W38wHYeBwl4k4?usp=sharing\n\n**January 2025 - Cipher Session Developer Connect** - https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1881669705766932964\n\nWe had developers from our previous solidity cipher session go through our opportunity connect sessions for Filecoin and other Blockchains.\n\n**February 2025 - Blockchain Analytics** - https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1884591379038277985\nDuring our Blockchain Analytics training, Filecoin data served as a key reference point for teaching developers and data analysts how to access, interpret, and visualize on-chain data. Participants explored Filecoin’s decentralized storage metrics, transaction records, and network insights to understand real-world blockchain data structures and analytics pipelines. \n\nHeld the Blockchain Event in Bayanero University and had attendees perform attestations onchain, we introduced attendees to the opportunities to the general Blockchain ecosystem, but we didn't focus on Filecoin. https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1894721446569492774\n\n\n**March - May - First Physical Cipher session for teaching developers to build with solidity and on Filecoin** https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1930992172976746693\n\nSee the Cipher Session classroom and class recordings here - https://t.me/borderlessclassroom\n\n**June 2025 - Opened the B<>rder/es web3 Product House in the University of Nigeria to raise more developers in the Filecoin Ecosystem**\nhttps://x.com/Borderlessunn/status/1929173093278171305\n\n**June - September 2025 – 2nd Cipher Session Launch** - https://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1939647543530393789\nWe opened registration for our second Cipher Session of the year, designed to equip students with hands-on skills in Solidity, frontend development, and UI/UX design, focusing on creating intuitive and accessible user experiences for Web3 applications.\n\nClass Group: https://t.me/cryptosmartcommunity\nCipher Session Data: Because it's sensitive student data, we kept it locked. Please request access and we'd approve it https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s_8smsCCLG_kbR-1Lz6FUcU9uIBMPfJ_?usp=drive_link\n\n**July 2025** - Opened the Web3 Media Content Studio to create content and support creators on Filecoin with equipment and shooting and editing skills.\nhttps://x.com/web3bmedia/status/1942144900025491744\n\n**September 2025 - Creation of the Byte Store SDK** - https://github.com/B-rder-ess-Dev-Hub/ByteStore-SDK\nA mini SDK that Simplifies Filecoin integration with easy-to-use methods for uploading, downloading, and managing files on the decentralized web. Used on byteonchain.xyz",
  "additional_impact": "Beyond education and tooling, B<>rder/ess has created a sustainable builder pipeline for the Filecoin ecosystem. Through our university hubs, Cipher Sessions, and Web3 events, we’ve helped transition developers into full-fledged builders and can now design and deploy projects powered by Filecoin.",
  "end_user": "The primary end users of the B<>rder/ess Developers Program are university students and early-career developers who are learning to build in Web3:\n\n1.  Developers and engineers gaining practical experience with Filecoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain tools.\n2. Designers and creatives building user-centered Web3 interfaces.\n3. Student founders and contributors launching on-chain products and public goods.\n\nUltimately, the broader Ethereum and Filecoin ecosystems also benefit as these trained builders contribute new tools, dApps, and innovations that strengthen decentralized infrastructure.",
  "testimonials": "Yes we've gotten positive reviews on B<>rder/ess Developers program from\n\n1. From Mr Kevin https://x.com/kevin_chibuoyim\n2. From Mr Temi https://x.com/temi0x\n3. From Mr Enoch https://x.com/Divine_Vessel\n4. From Mr Charles https://x.com/charliecodes\n\nAnd a lot more that might be in the ecosystem that we haven't mentioned.",
