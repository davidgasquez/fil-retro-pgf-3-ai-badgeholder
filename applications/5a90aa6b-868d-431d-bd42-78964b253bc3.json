  "description": "FilDOS is A Secure, AI-Native, Meaning-First Decentralized Drive that transforms how users store, search, and share data, by meaning, not identifiers. Built on Filecoin Onchain Cloud using the Synapse SDK, it bridges AI and Web3 to deliver intuitive, privacy-first, and programmable data ownership. \n\nFrom June 2025 to September 2025, FilDOS evolved from PLGenesis hackathon prototype to a functional product with semantic search, MCP server, and AI-powered organization, enabling users to truly own and monetize their data. The project’s impact lies in redefining decentralized storage making it smarter, accessible, and economically empowering for individuals and enterprises.\n\nFilDOS is also proud to share that we had demoed our product at Fil Dev Summit-7 Virtual this year.",

  "end_user": "FilDOS contributes to the decentralized data ecosystem by making AI-powered, user-friendly decentralized storage accessible to everyone. It bridges a key usability gap in Web3 by introducing semantic search, NFT-based ownership, and programmable access control, allowing users to interact with data intuitively and securely.\n\n#### Use Case 1 – Privacy-Focused Individual\n\nA user stores personal documents on FilDOS, encrypted via Lit Protocol, searchable by meaning, and shareable via paywalled public folders—maintaining full ownership while monetizing select content.\n\n#### Use Case 2 – Agent Developer\n\nA builder uses FilDOS MCP server to build agents managing their data on our decentralized file storage and AI-driven metadata tagging, reducing complexity while ensuring user data stays on-chain and private.\n\nUse Case 3 – Enterprise Team\n\nA distributed team can use FilDOS for collaborative document management with access permissions and AI-generated summaries, improving productivity and reducing cloud storage costs.",
  "testimonials": "Trusted by Innovators\n\n“This was super cool to see. For years, I’ve been hoping for something like this — a way to deliver a high-quality product experience to users in a familiar setting.”\n— Juan Benet, Founder & CEO, Protocol Labs (during PLGenesis Hackathon)\n\n“Clearly frames the usability gap in decentralized storage. The product is compelling, and I’m excited to see how it continues to differentiate from other storage + search solutions, AI or otherwise.”\n— Patrick Woodhead, Co-Founder, Space Meridian (Alpha Cohort Review)\n\n“There’s everything under the sun when it comes to file storage — but not with a paywall. It’s a really powerful unique selling proposition.”\n— Sabeen Ali, Founder & CEO, AngelHack (Founders Forge Cohort)\n\n[Link](https://www.fildos.cloud/#social-proof)",
