  "filecoin_growth_impact": "py-libp2p contributes to the Filecoin economy by expanding the number of developers and applications that can build on and interact with the network. While py-libp2p itself does not directly process FIL-denominated transactions (as it is a networking layer rather than a storage or deal execution layer), it enables Python-based applications to participate in Filecoin storage, retrieval, and coordination workflows.\n\nBy making libp2p and content addressing accessible in Python—the dominant language in AI, scientific computing, data processing, and research—we are increasing the range of workloads and datasets that can be stored and exchanged over Filecoin. This includes federated learning pipelines, academic datasets, and decentralized research collaborations now prototyping storage flows backed by Filecoin.\nNumerical Estimate of Economic Impact (Nov 2024 – Sept 2025):\n\n~10 active weekly users currently integrating Filecoin-enabled workflows through py-libp2p.\n\n50+ contributors and research collaborators gaining familiarity with Filecoin/IPFS protocols.\n\nMultiple academic and enterprise teams now designing data and compute workflows that result in new and recurring Filecoin storage usage (ongoing growth trajectory).\n\nIn short, the economic value of py-libp2p is network demand growth: it brings new developer groups into the Filecoin ecosystem, enabling applications that will store more data, run more retrievals, and expand real usage over time.",

  "description": "py-libp2p delivers a native Python implementation of the libp2p networking stack, making Filecoin and IPFS accessible to the large Python ecosystem of researchers, data scientists, and distributed systems developers. Between November 2024 and September 2025, we focused on stability, interoperability, and spec alignment, enabling reliable peer discovery, secure transports, and data exchange across networks. These improvements have powered new decentralized storage, federated learning, and distributed AI applications built on Filecoin & IPFS infrastructure. By maintaining core libraries (py-libp2p, py-multiaddr, py-cid), we reduce onboarding friction, expand developer reach, and unlock real experimentation and production deployment in Python-first environments.",
  "additional_impact": "Beyond core library maintenance, py-libp2p has played a meaningful role in education, ecosystem expansion, and applied decentralized systems development across the Filecoin network. The project has been adopted into curriculum at NSUT (Delhi), where students learn IPFS, libp2p, and Filecoin networking using the Python implementation, helping train the next generation of Filecoin-native developers and researchers. We have collaborated with teams across Protocol Labs, Huddle01, Storacha, LF Edge, NVIDIA, DataBricks, and multiple academic institutions, strengthening the ecosystem through shared prototyping, research, and interoperability work.\n\npy-libp2p has also supported real deployments and applied systems, including federated learning + Filecoin-backed data sharing, Storacha’s Proof-of-Contribution and decentralized care coordination platform, and early components of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud and Warm Storage SDK. We further contributed to interoperability work between Filecoin and Ethereum P2P stacks, enabling cross-network research and experimentation.\n\nWe actively participate in Filecoin EngRes knowledge-sharing and onboarding, improving developer workflows and ensuring Python support remains aligned with evolving ecosystem needs. Additionally, maintainers have represented Filecoin in public forums as keynote speakers at the Research Conclave (NSUT × Royal Society of Chemistry) and as judges and invited experts at the Industrial Ideathon held by the Government of NCT of Delhi, helping expand awareness of Filecoin in academic and policy innovation circles.\n\nOverall, py-libp2p contributes not only code, but education, community leadership, and sustained ecosystem cohesion—broadening who can build on Filecoin and how.",
  "end_user": "The primary end users of py-libp2p are Filecoin builders, researchers, and developers who require native Python support to integrate decentralized storage, retrieval, and networking into their applications. This includes Python developers building P2P, storage, or networking systems that depend on libp2p primitives; AI/ML engineers and data scientists who store, share, and federate datasets and models on Filecoin/IPFS using Python toolchains; and research labs and academic groups prototyping distributed experiments and reproducible data pipelines. It further supports decentralized application builders connecting Python-based services to Filecoin/IPFS, DevOps and infrastructure teams operating Filecoin Onchain Cloud or distributed compute stacks, and educators and students learning peer-to-peer networking with approachable Python examples.",
  "testimonials": "We have received strong positive testimonials from contributors and developers across the Filecoin, IPFS, and broader decentralized systems ecosystem. To date, there are 15+ public testimonials acknowledging the importance and impact of maintaining a Python-native libp2p stack. These include feedback from Protocol Labs researchers, Huddle01 engineers, NVIDIA and DataBricks AI practitioners, NSUT & NSUT IIF academic teams, the IPFS-kit-py team, LF Edge open-source contributors, and engineers from Ethereum’s lean libp2p working group and Starknet team.\n\nThese testimonials consistently highlight that py-libp2p lowers the barrier for Python developers to integrate Filecoin and IPFS, enables research and prototyping in AI and distributed systems, and expands the ecosystem beyond Go/Rust-centric development.\n\nLink to compiled testimonials: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WAA0dLDMVNyVb3SklJIiL8PNOQB58lX9?usp=drive_link",
