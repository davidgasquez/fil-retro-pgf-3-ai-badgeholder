  "description": "MechaFIL-Jax is the primary forecasting tool in the Filecoin ecosystem. It is used to determine the macroeconomic impact of FIPs, helping maintainers steward the economy and evaluate protocol updates. It also enables Storage Providers to create business plans and make quantitative decisions about where the economy is headed.",
  "additional_impact": "The primary forecasting tool in the Filecoin ecosystem, used to determine the impact of every FIP to Filecoin, used in business decisions to understand where the economy is headed, enabling business decisions to be made with quantitative input. Some artifacts that are used actively by the Filecoin community include:\n\nFIP 100 simulations -  https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0100.md \nhttps://fip100-79951936690.us-central1.run.app \nveFIL simulations -  https://vefil-calculator.streamlit.app/ \nCirc Supply Forecasting Utility -  https://mechafil-jax-web-79951936690.us-central1.run.app/ \nSP Cost Web -  https://sp-cost-web-79951936690.us-central1.run.app",
  "end_user": "The entire filecoin community benefits from MechaFIL-Jax and derivative projects.  Help SPs forecast and create business plans, help maintainers steward the economy and evaluate the tradeoffs of economic updates that are proposed. \n\nA recent example of this was the evaluations that were done to determine the best approach for FIP 100.  Evaluations of various policies and iterations that were explored using the MechaFIL JAX simulation engine are in this repository:\nhttps://github.com/CELtd/cel/tree/kiran/notebooks/proof_fees \n\nAnother recent example is the veFIL proposal, and the modeling work around veFIL to determine macroeconomic impacts: https://vefil-calculator.streamlit.app/",
  "testimonials": "While we do not have a formal repository of testimonials , the project's value is demonstrated by its adoption as the primary forecasting tool in the Filecoin ecosystem. It is a direct dependency for all major protocol economic analyses, and our primary users are protocol maintainers and research groups who rely on it to evaluate FIPs such as FIP 100 and veFIL .",

  "usability_or_infrastructure_impact": "MechaFIL-JAX provides the validation needed to enable major usability and infrastructure improvements. For example, modeling using this tool was an essential prerequisite for FIP 100. By using MechaFIL-Jax to model and validate the design of FIP 100 , MechaFIL-Jax the data-driven evidence that the change was economically sound and would achieve its goals - which enabled the FIP to move forward.",
  "efficiency_increase_impact": "MechaFIL-Jax was the tool used to model and validate the design of FIP 100. Our simulations quantitatively demonstrated that the proposed changes can lead to gas cost reductions (approx. 30%). This analysis provided the evidence needed to progress the FIP.",
  "performance_impact": "A recent system performance improvement enabled by our work is the increased scalability and throughput of the Filecoin network, - a result of FIP 100 modeling.",
