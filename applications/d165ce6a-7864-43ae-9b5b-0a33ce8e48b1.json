  "filecoin_growth_impact": "By ensuring that new and recovering nodes can reliably connect to the Filecoin network, this bootstrap node directly supports network growth and stability — prerequisites for any FIL-denominated activity. Every storage deal, retrieval, and proof on Filecoin depends on a healthy peer network, and this node has facilitated thousands of connections from miners, storage providers, and clients joining the mainnet.",

  "description": "One of 4 bootstrap nodes currently used by lotus, only one providing bootstrap connectivity over middlebox-happy ports/protocols. Maintaining a reliable bootstrap node is critical for ensuring that new and existing Filecoin nodes can seamlessly join and stay connected to the network, especially in environments with restrictive firewalls or NATs. This infrastructure enhances network resilience, decentralization, and accessibility for a diverse global user base. Continued support ensures long-term stability and robustness of the Filecoin mainnet’s peer discovery process.",
