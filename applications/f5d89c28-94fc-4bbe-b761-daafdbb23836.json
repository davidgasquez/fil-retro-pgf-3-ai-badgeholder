  "description": "Filecoin's retrievability has always held Filecoin back. And the issue has always been lack of incentives. With the launch of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud and Filecoin Beam, SP can now - for the first time - be paid for the data they serve, thus incentivizing retrieval.\n\n**Filecoin Beam** is the incentivized data delivery layer of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud, providing reliable, low-latency retrieval while metering egress on-chain for the first time. SPs can now earn for serving content. Beam is a foundational building block in the Filecoin Onchain Cloud, with many teams building dApps and services on top of it. Beam transforms Filecoin retrievals into a verifiable, economically aligned service, reducing integration complexity, improving ecosystem composability, and enabling consumer-grade application performance on Filecoin's verifiable storage.",
  "additional_impact": "-   **Economic alignment for SPs**: Introduces the first trustless, pay-per-byte retrieval incentives on Filecoin, addressing long-standing gaps in SP business models.\n    \n-   **Standardization and composability**: Beam creates a single, canonical retrieval endpoint, allowing new applications to plug into the Filecoin Onchain Cloud without custom integration for each SP.\n    \n-   **Foundation for future protocols**: By proving pay-per-byte economics on-chain, Beam enables other CDNs and gateways to adopt trustless retrieval incentives, fostering competition, decentralization, and resilience at the access layer.\n    \n-   **Improved developer adoption**: Lowering the barrier to integrate Filecoin storage accelerates ecosystem growth, enabling more applications to rely on verifiable decentralized storage.\n\n**In summary**, Filecoin Beam transforms retrieval from an opaque, un-incentivized, SP-dependent process into a **verifiable, economically aligned, globally performant service**. By combining canonical URLs, global caching, incentivized egress, and on-chain measurement, Beam unlocks reliable, low-latency access for apps and end users while incentivizing Storage Providers to deliver high-quality service - laying the foundation for the next generation of dApps, services and protocols built on Filecoin.",
  "end_user": "-   **App developers and Filecoin Onchain Cloud clients**: Beam provides a single, canonical URL for all retrievals, eliminating the need to handle multiple SP endpoints and reducing integration complexity. Applications can reliably fetch data across the network, enabling composable and scalable services. Beam is integrated into - and available to use in - the Synapse SDK.\n    \n-   **End users**: Benefit from faster, more reliable retrievals thanks to Beam’s globally distributed cache layer, which reduces cross-continental latency and ensures content availability even if some SPs are offline, provided it has already been cached in Filecoin Beam.\n    \n-   **Storage Providers (SPs)**: Gain a **trustless, earn-per-byte incentive layer** for egress, improved infrastructure protection from DDoS attacks, and reduced operational risk.\n    \n-   **The Filecoin ecosystem**: Gains a verifiable, measurable retrieval and data delivery layer that aligns incentives, encourages reliability, drives adoption by standardizing access, and moves the needle for PMF.",
  "testimonials": "Filecoin Beam has received strong validation from both ecosystem developers and ecosystem funders who recognize its pivotal role in solving Filecoin’s long-standing retrievability woes.\n\nThe most significant endorsement has come from FIL ProPGF, which provided dedicated funding to help launch and scale Filecoin Beam as part of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud initiative. This support reflects the community’s recognition that retrieval performance and reliability are critical priorities for the Filecoin network, and that Beam is the leading solution addressing them.\n\nBeyond funding, developer and builder feedback has been positive. Teams participating in the Modular Worlds Hackathon (July 2025) and Akindo Buildathon (August - November 2025) have praised Beam for dramatically simplifying data access, improving retrieval speed, and providing an incentive layer that aligns SPs and developers.\n\nIn governance and technical discussions, Beam is frequently cited as the flagship retrieval effort within the ecosystem - essential for making Filecoin storage useful through verifiable, performant data delivery.\n\nTogether, these testimonials demonstrate broad recognition that Filecoin Beam is not only technically effective, but strategically important for Filecoin’s continued growth and usability.",

These projects were evaluated by our team and showcased Beam’s ease of integration and performance advantages, as well as giving us invaluable early feedback.\n\nMany of these teams have since joined the Alpha Cohort of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud initiative, continuing to develop production-grade applications that depend on Beam.\n\nThirdly, the Akindo Buildathon on Filecoin Onchain Cloud attracted 70+ team submissions, many of which incorporated FWSS and Filecoin Beam as core components for data storage and retrieval.\n\nThese builders have provided strong feedback validating Beam’s role as the retrieval and delivery backbone of the Filecoin Onchain Cloud, and highlighting its value for both developers and Storage Providers.\n\nIn total, dozens of active projects and prototypes are now directly leveraging Filecoin Beam’s APIs, retrieval incentives, and delivery mechanisms - establishing it as a core dependency for the emerging Filecoin Onchain Cloud stack.",
  "usability_or_infrastructure_impact": "-   **Standardized access URL**: Beam consolidates multiple SP endpoints into [https://filbeam.io](https://filbeam.io), dramatically improving UX and lowering developer onboarding friction.\n    \n-   **Global retrieval performance**: Cross-continental latency is reduced via a distributed cache layer, providing consumer-grade speed for apps built on Filecoin PDP.\n    \n-   **High reliability**: Beam introduces redundant delivery paths and caching, mitigating SP downtime.\n    \n-   **On-chain, incentivized retrieval**: Beam records egress metrics on-chain, enabling SPs to earn-per-byte in a verifiable, trustless manner.\n    \n-   **Security and operational protection**: Acts as a firewall for SPs, reducing load and exposure to unpredictable traffic and DDoS attacks.",
  "efficiency_increase_impact": "-   **Egress optimization**: By introducing pay-per-byte incentives and a CDN-like cache layer, Beam encourages SPs to deliver data efficiently and reliably.\n    \n-   **Reduced integration overhead**: Developers spend less time managing multiple SP endpoints and failover logic, effectively increasing ecosystem throughput.\n    \n-   **Global caching**: Reduces redundant cross-continental data retrieval, lowering bandwidth usage and latency.",
  "performance_impact": "On calibration net, Filecoin Beam has achieved a cache-hit rate of 81.03% at the time of writing. This represents a major improvement in network efficiency: the majority of retrievals are now served directly from Beam’s distributed cache layer rather than individual Storage Providers (SPs). As a result, SP egress load is significantly reduced, and global data retrievals avoid repetitive long-distance round trips - lowering latency and improving user experience for applications built on Filecoin.\n\nBeam also enables the Filecoin Onchain Cloud to offer a network-wide availability/retrievability SLA, rather than fragmented SP-by-SP reliability guarantees. This transforms the UX of Filecoin offering from a collection of independent storage providers into a unified, high-availability retrieval network suitable for production-grade applications.\n\nFurthermore, Beam introduces retrieval incentives directly tied to verifiable on-chain metrics. Once the FWSS (Filecoin Warm Storage Service) contract is deployed to mainnet and thus Filecoin Beam is available on Mainnet, SPs will begin receiving 7 USDFC per TiB of egress they serve as an initial incentive rate. This will create, for the first time, a measurable and economically aligned retrieval marketplace on Filecoin - one that rewards reliable, performant data delivery and closes the loop between storage and access.",
