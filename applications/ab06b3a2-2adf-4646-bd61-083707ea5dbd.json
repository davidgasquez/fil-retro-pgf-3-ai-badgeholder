  "description": "The [Filecoin Data Portal](https://filecoindataportal.xyz/) has continued evolving and growing in the last few months! New dashboards, datasets, metrics and reports are out there. Let's take a look at the biggest impact areas.\n\n- The portal is now serving the [main OKRs/KPIs](https://numbers.filecoindataportal.xyz/kpis) view into the ecosystem. Actively used by teams to drive meetings like WBR.\n- Refreshed the look of the [main dashboards](https://numbers.filecoindataportal.xyz/) and added more than 15 new charts.\n- Served more than 100 ad-hoc data requests.\n- Added [more than 20 new metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1uq9J_WTJO6kAvQlrqkqR8GHfQfh3SJ84OSj88Mff6vY/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Helped uncover and analyze bugs (e.g: state related to FIP-0074 not being cleaned up as expected).\n- Continued providing up to date metrics to VCs and stakeholders.\n- Curated 5 new completely new datasets (custom onramps mapping and details, new allocator details, filecoin market price and volume, ...)\n- All while keeping all code open and using public infrastructure. You can clone the repo and reproduce eveything in your laptop!\n\nYou can [check the commits to see all details](https://github.com/davidgasquez/filecoin-data-portal/commits/main/) too!",
  "additional_impact": "There have been other initiatives that the Filecoin Data Portal has driven but haven't materialized for now. E.g: the [Filecoin Storage Providers Market Dashboard](https://filecoin-project.github.io/filecoin-storage-providers-market/). There are also a a few [experimental dashboards](https://nexusdatalabs.github.io/filecoin-watch/clients/?page=1&sort=total_deals&dir=desc) in the works!",
  "end_user": "- Stakeholders\n- Teams in need of open and eaisly accessible metrics\n- Overall ecosystem players looking for the state of it\n- VCs",
  "testimonials": "No direct links to testimonials but stakeholders are very happy with the data platform and dashboards!",
