  "filecoin_growth_impact": "Our tools and dashboards are contributing towards the confidence and trust that ecosystem partners, application builders and investors need to have in order to get more involved and build on Filecoin. For instance, ProbeLab extended and enhanced its monitoring towards IPNI, which faced some service disruption recently - see: https://dev.probelab.io/ipfs/ipni/cid.contact.\n\nAlthough not directly touching on Filecoin economy, these metrics and services provided by ProbeLab are critical for the correct operation of the network.",

  "description": "ProbeLab has been building and extending it's tooling to monitor the health and performance of the Filecoin network. ProbeLab's tools run 24/7 to collect data, which is subsequently processed and analysed to produce meaningful plots and dashboards. Alongside the plots, our tools are set up to raise alerts in case specific values go above certain thresholds.\n\nProbeLab has extended one of its flagship tools, Hermes, to create a Filecoin lightnode, of sorts, that can participate in the network receive and forward (but not create) messages and as such monitor the traffic and performance of the network in real-time.\n\nProbeLab has also enhanced its monitoring of IPNI and shows prominently the performance of all indexers: https://dev.probelab.io/ipfs/ipni/cid.contact.",
  "additional_impact": "ProbeLab's metrics are publicly available and in many cases not supported by the corresponding foundation or project. In order for us to be able to continue probing the network, collecting data and producing dashboards, it is imperative that the community supports us through funding mechanisms like this.",
