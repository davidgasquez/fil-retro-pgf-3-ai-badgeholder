  "description": "Lynx measures Storage Providers’ real-world retrieval performance across HTTP, Graphsync, and Bitswap using DDO-backed randomized SubPiece sampling. Since Nov 2024, it has delivered an end-to-end pipeline, public dashboards, and APIs that enable SPs and integrators to track SLA compliance and retrieval success rates globally.",
  "additional_impact": "Established a common benchmark for retrieval SLA measurement used across multiple ecosystem tools.",
  "end_user": "Lynx primarily serves Storage Providers (SPs), allocators, and ecosystem developers who need reliable retrieval performance data.\n\t•\tSPs use Lynx dashboards and APIs to monitor their retrieval success rates, latency, and SLA compliance across protocols (HTTP, Graphsync, Bitswap).\n\t•\tAllocators and governance reviewers rely on Lynx reports to validate data reliability before approving DataCap.\n\t•\tDevelopers and integrators use Lynx APIs to enhance routing, client-side reliability scoring, and data audit workflows.",
  "testimonials": "Lynx has received 10+ positive testimonials from SP operators, tooling developers, and allocators.\n\t•\tMultiple SPs confirmed that Lynx helped them identify region-specific latency issues and improve retrieval SLAs.\n\t•\tTooling teams integrating Lynx API reported faster retrieval analytics and better reliability reporting.",
