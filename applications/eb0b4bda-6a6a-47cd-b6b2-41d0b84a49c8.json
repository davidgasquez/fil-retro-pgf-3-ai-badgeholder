  "description": "💧 **Drips** is the super-app for funding Open Source. It enables organizations to flexibly fund any open-source repository on GitHub with any ERC-20 token, as One-Time Donations, or continuous streams. Using **Drip Lists**, many repositories and addresses can be funded all at once.\n\nWhen a repository claims funding, it can **forward a percentage of funds to its dependencies**, creating a **global, fundable dependency graph**.\n\nDrips has been deployed on Filecoin since late 2023, when it was first used to **[distribute rewards for FIL-RetroPGF-2](https://filecoin.drips.network/app/drip-lists/45193817480599985262554974973835763972521255481357121508020698376704)**. This year, we're providing the entire end-to-end tooling for the round with our new **[RetroPGF feature](https://www.drips.network/solutions/retro-pgf)** (which you're using right now!)",
