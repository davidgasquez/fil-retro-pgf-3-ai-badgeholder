  "description": "Beryx is a Filecoin explorer built to make it easier for anyone to navigate and understand the Filecoin blockchain. With Beryx, you can explore addresses, contracts, transactions, and blocks, or simply get a sense of what’s happening across the network. It also lets you interact with smart contracts using wallets like Ledger and MetaMask, so you can experiment and build without extra setup. Beryx also offers helpful tools such as contract verification, a gas estimator, and rich network statistics, features that make it useful for both curious users and developers working with Filecoin every day. We keep improving Beryx day to day thanks to the community’s feedback and the team’s ongoing effort to make it faster, more reliable, and a little nicer to use each time you visit.",
