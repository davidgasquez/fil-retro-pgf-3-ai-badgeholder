  "description": "Shipyard maintains essential IPFS public utilities that the ecosystem depends on. These include the ipfs.io and dweb.link HTTP gateways, the trustless-gateway.link Trustless gateway endpoint, the delegated-ipfs.dev Delegated Routing endpoint, the Amino DHT bootstrappers, the IPFS Check (check.ipfs.network) utility, and other IPFS public network services and tooling. These utilities make it possible to experiment with new lightweight clients, to retrieve data from the IPFS network in resource-constrained environments such as browsers and low-powered devices, and to provide a space for new users to tinker with these technologies.",
  "additional_impact": "The IPFS Public Gateways are a major way that people access IPFS mainnet data today, and it's a major tool for onboarding users to IPFS and then onwards to Filecoin as they users look towards who can store data for them so they don't have to self-host their data. Adding data to a local kubo node, a centralized IPFS pinning service, or storing data on Filecoin followed by trying to retrieve it via ipfs.io / dweb.link is one of the most common tests/onboarding experiences in the ecosystem.\n\nThe Amino DHT bootstrappers are overall critical to network health. While they are only a bootstrapping mechanism into the Amino DHT new users would have no way to join the decentralized network themselves without bootstrappers present.\n\nThe delegated routing and trustless gateway utilities are enabling IPFS implementations to implement the pieces of the IPFS stack they are able to vs forcing an all (implementing all IPFS protocols and subsystems) or nothing (using a gateway to an endpoint that does all the IPFS work) mentality. In-browser helia today uses these to enable client-side validation and data retrieval, while being able to get help with areas where browsers could use some help.",
  "end_user": "Boxo both powers the internals of the Filecoin network, as well as the external-user facing side of the network by being the most widely used IPFS implementation.\n\nAny user of kubo, ipfs.io / dweb.link, IPFS Desktop, IPFS websites loaded via eth.limo, etc. are all using boxo under the hood. Additionally, work on boxo and kubo tends to be the major driver in IPFS compatibility tooling, specifications and overall evolution.",
  "testimonials": "Almost every user of IPFS mainnet touches these public utilities and in both the Filecoin ecosystem and elsewhere people reach out wanting to ensure interoperability with the public utilities due to the value and ease of use they provide.\n\nDebugging tools like IPFS Check have been helping users self-diagnose issues with their content (or their providers) and has received much supportive feedback.\n\nAs an example in the course of development on Filecoin Pin (https://docs.filecoin.io/builder-cookbook/filecoin-pin) the team has been using the ipfs.io / dweb.link public gateways as well as the service-worker gateway at inbrowser.link, and debugging tooling at check.ipfs.network to ensure users have a good experience with the service.",
