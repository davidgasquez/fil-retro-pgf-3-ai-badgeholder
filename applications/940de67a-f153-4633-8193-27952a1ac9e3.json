  "description": "Ancients Research has helped clients in Filecoin ecosystem to strategize & grow in the past bearish climate and has been an active governance participant in FIP discussions. Clients (including `pro bono` sessions with Filecoin Foundation, Filponto, etc) were consulted on many aspects of Filecoin including but not limited to data onboarding, f+ governance issues, mining ROIs, mining tech stack, local markets / regulations, fil lending etc. to ultimately build a antifragile business within the Fileocin ecosystem. On the governance side, Ancients Research has proposed 1 FIP ([1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/1083)) which are designed to reinvigorate the network.",
