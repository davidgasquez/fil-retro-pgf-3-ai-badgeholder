  "filecoin_growth_impact": "**Filecoin Onchain Cloud** extends the Filecoin economy by enabling **service providers** to deliver verifiable storage, retrieval, and payment services entirely on-chain.\n\nBy integrating **FWSS**, **PDP**, and **on-chain settlement mechanisms**, FOC unlocks new FIL-denominated transaction flows between clients and providers.\n\nThis framework introduces a direct economic layer for on-chain service operation, expanding real FIL utility beyond collateral and deal payments to ongoing data verification, retrieval billing, and automated settlement.",

  "description": "Throughout the RetroPGF Round 3 period, FilOz developed the **Filecoin Onchain Cloud (FOC)** framework that powers verifiable storage, retrieval, and payment services on the Filecoin network.\n\nFOC underpins applications such as **Filecoin Pin**, **Synapse SDK**, **demo.filecoin.services**, **Filecoin Pay**, and **PDP Scan**, enabling service providers and developers to build and operate on-chain data services with verifiable proofs and crypto-native payments.\n\nTogether, these components form the foundation for scalable, transparent, and interoperable Filecoin-based cloud services.",
  "additional_impact": "FOC accelerated collaboration across multiple Filecoin ecosystem teams by providing a shared framework for building, testing, and verifying on-chain services.\n\nIt introduced standard interfaces for monitoring and validating data operations, simplifying how new service layers interact with the Filecoin protocol.\n\nThe project also established operational benchmarks for reliability and performance, informing future service design and infrastructure planning across the broader Filecoin Onchain Cloud roadmap.",
  "end_user": "The Filecoin Onchain Cloud (FOC) serves the next generation of Filecoin Service Providers who deliver verifiable storage, retrieval, and payment services directly on-chain.\n\nIt gives SPs a unified operational framework - including FWSS, PDP nodes, and on-chain payment tooling - to run scalable, transparent, and performance-verified infrastructure.\n\nFOC also empowers builders and developers who extend these capabilities through dashboards, SDKs, and data service integrations, creating an open ecosystem of interoperable on-chain services built on Filecoin.",
  "testimonials": "Positive feedback came from **FOC Alpha** participants, early **PDP pilot** operators, and **SPX** cohort members during PDP rollouts and FWSS trials.\n\nComments in relevant Slack channels and program feedback forms consistently noted clear documentation, fast issue response, and reliable on-chain components.\n\nJudging notes and tracker entries from the FOC Alpha and SPX programs reflected sustained confidence that FOC is a practical foundation for verifiable, on-chain Filecoin services.\n\n[https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/1PRjgGzKaTqXaQBBl](https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/1PRjgGzKaTqXaQBBl)",
